eu rejects german call to boycott british lamb .
peter blackburn
brussels 1996-08-22
the european commission said on thursday it disagreed with german advice to consumers to shun british lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .
germany 's representative to the european union 's veterinary committee werner zwingmann said on wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than britain until the scientific advice was clearer .
" we do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the commission 's chief spokesman nikolaus van der pas told a news briefing .
he said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the european union .
he said a proposal last month by eu farm commissioner franz fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .
fischler proposed eu-wide measures after reports from britain and france that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) -- mad cow disease .
but fischler agreed to review his proposal after the eu 's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .
spanish farm minister loyola de palacio had earlier accused fischler at an eu farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "
.
only france and britain backed fischler 's proposal .
the eu 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .
sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to bse which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .
british farmers denied on thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that german government advice to consumers to avoid british lamb might influence consumers across europe .
" what we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take germany 's lead , " welsh national farmers ' union ( nfu ) chairman john lloyd jones said on bbc radio .
bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in march after a british report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .
germany imported 47,600 sheep from britain last year , nearly half of total imports .
it brought in 4,275 tonnes of british mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .
rare hendrix song draft sells for almost $ 17,000 .
london 1996-08-22
a rare early handwritten draft of a song by u.s. guitar legend jimi hendrix was sold for almost $ 17,000 on thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions .
a florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds ( $ 16,935 ) for the draft of " ai n't no telling " , which hendrix penned on a piece of london hotel stationery in late 1966 .
at the end of a january 1967 concert in the english city of nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan .
buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by hendrix 's former girlfriend kathy etchingham , who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 .
they included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by hendrix to store his drugs , which an anonymous australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds ( $ 7,845 ) .
the guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27 .
china says taiwan spoils atmosphere for talks .
beijing 1996-08-22
china on thursday accused taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the taiwan strait with a visit to ukraine by taiwanese vice president lien chan this week that infuriated beijing .
speaking only hours after chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with taiwan , foreign ministry spokesman shen guofang told reuters : " the necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the taiwan authorities . "
state media quoted china 's top negotiator with taipei , tang shubei , as telling a visiting group from taiwan on wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks .
" now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ...
that is to end the state of hostility , " thursday 's overseas edition of the people 's daily quoted tang as saying .
the foreign ministry 's shen told reuters television in an interview he had read reports of tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with taiwan , which beijing considers a renegade province .
china , which has long opposed all taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition , was infuriated by a visit to ukraine this week by taiwanese vice president lien .

german july car registrations up 14.2 pct yr / yr .
frankfurt 1996-08-22
german first-time registrations of motor vehicles jumped 14.2 percent in july this year from the year-earlier period , the federal office for motor vehicles said on thursday .
the office said 356,725 new cars were registered in july 1996 -- 304,850 passenger cars and 15,613 trucks .
the figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from july 1995 .
motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period .
the growth was partly due to an increased number of germans buying german cars abroad , while manufacturers said that domestic demand was weak , the federal office said .
almost all german car manufacturers posted gains in registration numbers in the period .
volkswagen ag won 77,719 registrations , slightly more than a quarter of the total .
opel ag together with general motors came in second place with 49,269 registrations , 16.4 percent of the overall figure .
third was ford with 35,563 registrations , or 11.7 percent .
only seat and porsche had fewer registrations in july 1996 compared to last year 's july .
seat posted 3,420 registrations compared with 5522 registrations in july a year earlier .
porsche 's registrations fell to 554 from 643 .

israel plays down fears of war with syria .
colleen siegel
jerusalem 1996-08-22
israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with syria said on thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup .
itamar rabinovich , who as israel 's ambassador to washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with syria , told israel radio it looked like damascus wanted to talk rather than fight .
" it appears to me the syrian priority is still to negotiate .
the syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said .
rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador .
he will be replaced by eliahu ben-elissar , a former israeli envoy to egypt and right-wing likud party politician .
israel on wednesday sent syria a message , via washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions .
but it slammed damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere .
syria accused israel on wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after israeli television reported that damascus had recently test fired a missile .
it said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes .
" the message that we sent to ( syrian president hafez al- ) assad is that israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " israeli foreign minister david levy told israel radio in an interview .
tension has mounted since israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu took office in june vowing to retain the golan heights israel captured from syria in the 1967 middle east war .
israeli-syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make golan concessions .
peace talks between the two sides were last held in february .
" the voices coming out of damascus are bad , not good .
the media ...
are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...
this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " levy said .
" we expect from syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . "
we do not want a war , god forbid .
no one benefits from wars . "
israel 's channel two television said damascus had sent a " calming signal " to israel .
it gave no source for the report .
netanyahu and levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it .
the television also said that netanyahu had sent messages to reassure syria via cairo , the united states and moscow .
polish diplomat denies nurses stranded in libya .
tunis 1996-08-22
a polish diplomat on thursday denied a polish tabloid report this week that libya was refusing exit visas to 100 polish nurses trying to return home after working in the north african country .
" this is not true .
up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in libya without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in tripoli , tadeusz awdankiewicz , told reuters by telephone .
poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to libya to investigate , but awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries .
he said that there are an estimated 800 polish nurses working in libya .
two iranian opposition leaders meet in baghdad .
hassan hafidh
baghdad 1996-08-22
an iranian exile group based in iraq vowed on thursday to extend support to iran 's kurdish rebels after they were attacked by iranian troops deep inside iraq last month .
a mujahideen khalq statement said its leader massoud rajavi met in baghdad the secretary-general of the kurdistan democratic party of iran ( kdpi ) hassan rastegar on wednesday and voiced his support to iran 's rebel kurds .
" rajavi emphasised that the iranian resistance would continue to stand side by side with their kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in iranian kurdistan , " it said .
a spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between mujahideen khalq and the iranian kurdish oppositions " .
iran heavily bombarded targets in northern iraq in july in pursuit of kdpi guerrillas based in iraqi kurdish areas outside the control of the government in baghdad .
iraqi kurdish areas bordering iran are under the control of guerrillas of the iraqi kurdish patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) group .
puk and iraq 's kurdistan democratic party ( kdp ) the two main iraqi kurdish factions , have had northern iraq under their control since iraqi forces were ousted from kuwait in the 1991 gulf war .
clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a u.s.-sponsored ceasefire last year .
mujahideen khalq said iranian troops had also been shelling kdp positions in qasri region in suleimaniya province near the iranian border over the last two days .
it said about 100 iraqi kurds were killed or wounded in the attack .
both iran and turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern iraq in pursuit of their own kurdish rebels .

israel approves arafat 's flight to west bank .
jerusalem 1996-08-22
israel gave palestinian president yasser arafat permission on thursday to fly over its territory to the west bank , ending a brief israeli-plo crisis , an arafat adviser said .
" the problem is over .
the president 's aircraft has received permission to pass through israeli airspace but the president is not expected to travel to the west bank before monday , " nabil abu rdainah told reuters .
arafat had been scheduled to meet former israeli prime minister shimon peres in the west bank town of ramallah on thursday but the venue was changed to gaza after israel denied flight clearance to the palestinian leader 's helicopters .
palestinian officials accused right-wing prime minister benjamin netanyahu of trying to stop the ramallah meeting by keeping arafat grounded .
arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between israeli and plo officials , on civilian affairs , at the allenby bridge crossing between jordan and the west bank .
abu rdainah said arafat had decided against flying to the west bank on thursday , after israel lifted the ban , because he had a busy schedule in gaza and would not be free until monday .
arafat to meet peres in gaza after flight ban .
jerusalem 1996-08-22
yasser arafat will meet shimon peres in gaza on thursday after palestinians said the right-wing israeli government had barred the palestinian leader from flying to the west bank for talks with the former prime minister .
" the meeting between peres and arafat will take place at erez checkpoint in gaza and not in ramallah as planned , " peres ' office said .
palestinian officials said the israeli government had barred arafat from overflying israel in a palestinian helicopter to the west bank in an attempt to bar the meeting with peres .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has accused opposition leader peres , who he defeated in may elections , of trying to undermine his likud government 's authority to conduct peace talks .
afghan uae embassy says taleban guards going home .
hilary gush
dubai 1996-08-22
three afghan guards brought to the united arab emirates last week by russian hostages who escaped from the taleban militia will return to afghanistan in a few days , the afghan embassy in abu dhabi said on thursday .
" our ambassador is in touch with the uae foreign ministry .
their return to afghanistan will take place in two or three days , " an embassy official said .
" the embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland .
there is no objection to their travel , " he added .
the three islamic taleban guards were overpowered by seven russian aircrew who escaped to uae state sharjah last friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of taleban militia in kandahar in southern afghanistan .
the uae said on monday it would hand over the three to the international red crescent , possibly last tuesday .
it has since been silent on the issue .
when asked whether the three guards would travel back to kandahar or the afghan capital kabul , the embassy official said : " that has not been decided , but possibly kandahar . "
kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition taleban militia .
kabul is controlled by president burhanuddin rabbani 's government , which taleban is fighting to overthrow .
the embassy official said the three men , believed to be in their 20s , were currently in abu dhabi .
he did not elaborate .
the russians , working for the aerostan firm in the russian republic of tatarstan , were taken hostage after a taleban mig-19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in august 1995 .
taleban said its shipment of ammunition from albania was evidence of russian military support for rabbani 's government .
moscow said the crew 's nationality was coincidental .
numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed .
the russians , who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with kalashnikov automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their ilyushin 76 cargo plane last friday , left the uae capital abu dhabi for home on sunday .
iraq 's saddam meets russia 's zhirinovsky .
baghdad 1996-08-22
iraqi president saddam hussein has told visiting russian ultra-nationalist vladimir zhirinovsky that baghdad wanted to maintain " friendship and cooperation " with moscow , official iraqi newspapers said on thursday .
" president saddam hussein stressed during the meeting iraq 's keenness to maintain friendship and cooperation with russia , " the papers said .
they said zhirinovsky told saddam before he left baghdad on wednesday that his liberal democratic party and the russian duma ( parliament ) " are calling for an immediate lifting of the embargo " imposed on iraq after its 1990 invasion of kuwait .
zhirinovsky said on tuesday he would press the russian government to help end u.n. trade sanctions on iraq and blamed moscow for delaying establishment of good ties with baghdad .
" our stand is firm , namely we are calling on ( the russian ) government to end the economic embargo on iraq and resume trade ties between russia and iraq , " he told reporters .
zhirinovsky visited iraq twice in 1995 .
last october he was invited to attend the referendum held on iraq 's presidency , which extended saddam 's term for seven more years .

finland 's trade surplus rose to 3.83 billion markka in april from 3.43 billion in march , the national customs board ( ncb ) said in a statement on thursday .

german farm ministry tells consumers to avoid british mutton .
bonn 1996-08-22
germany 's agriculture ministry suggested on wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from british sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals .
" until this is cleared up by the european union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official werner zwingmann told zdf television .
" i do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . "
there are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . "
bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in march when britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef .
the european commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some eu veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified .
eu farm commissioner franz fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from britain and france that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) -- mad cow disease .
but some members of the eu 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health .
the question is being studied separately by two eu scientific committees .
sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to bse which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .
british officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat .
zdf said germany imported 47,600 sheep from britain last year , nearly half of total imports .
it brought in 4,275 tonnes of british mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .
after the british government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the eu imposed a worldwide ban on british beef exports .
eu leaders agreed at a summit in june to a progressive lifting of the ban as britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .

like prescott , jack berry , trainer of mind games , had gone into thursday 's race in search of a first group one success after many years around the top of his profession .
berry said : " i`m disappointed but i do n't feel suicidal .
he ( mind games ) was going as well as any of them one and a half furlongs ( 300 metres ) out but he just did n't quicken . "

soccer - dalglish sad over blackburn parting .
london 1996-08-22
kenny dalglish spoke on thursday of his sadness at leaving blackburn , the club he led to the english premier league title in 1994-95 .
blackburn announced on wednesday they and dalglish had parted by mutual consent .
but the ex-manager confessed on thursday to being " sad " at leaving after taking blackburn from the second division to the premier league title inside three and a half years .
in a telephone call to a local newspaper from his holiday home in spain , dalglish said : " we came to the same opinion , albeit the club came to it a little bit earlier than me . "
he added : " if no one asked , i never opened my mouth .
i have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job .
the club thought it ( the job ) had run its course and i came to the same conclusion . "
dalglish had been with blackburn for nearly five years , first as manager and then , for the past 15 months , as director of football .

tennis - newcombe ponders his davis cup future .
sydney 1996-08-22
australian davis cup captain john newcombe on thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against croatia next month .
the former wimbledon champion said the immediate future of australia 's davis cup coach tony roche could also be determined by events in split .
" if we lose this one , tony and i will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , " newcombe was quoted as saying in sydney 's daily telegraph newspaper .
australia face croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from september 20-22 .
under newcombe 's leadership , australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the 26-time davis cup winners had slipped from the top rank .
since taking over as captain from neale fraser in 1994 , newcombe 's record in tandem with roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses .
newcombe has selected wimbledon semifinalist jason stoltenberg , patrick rafter , mark philippoussis , and olympic doubles champions todd woodbridge and mark woodforde to face the croatians .
the home side boasts world number six goran ivanisevic , and newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the croatian number one .
" we are ready to fight to our last breath -- australia must play at its absolute best to win , " said newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain .
australia last won the davis cup in 1986 , but they were beaten finalists against germany three years ago under fraser 's guidance .

baseball - orioles ' manager davey johnson hospitalized .
baltimore 1996-08-22
baltimore orioles manager davey johnson will miss thursday night 's game against the seattle mariners after being admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat .
the 53-year-old johnson was hospitalized after experiencing dizziness .
" he is in no danger and will be treated and observed this evening , " said orioles team physician dr. william goldiner , adding that johnson is expected to be released on friday .
orioles ' bench coach andy etchebarren will manage the club in johnson 's absence .
johnson is the second manager to be hospitalized this week after california angels skipper john mcnamara was admitted to new york 's columbia presbyterian hospital on wednesday with a blood clot in his left calf .
johnson , who played eight seasons in baltimore , was named orioles manager in the off-season replacing phil regan .
he led the cincinnati reds to the national league championship series last year and guided the new york mets to a world series championship in 1986 .
baltimore has won 16 of its last 22 games to pull within five games of the slumping new york yankees in the american league east division .

with one out , greer hit a 1-1 pitch from julian tavarez ( 4-7 ) over the right-field fence for his 15th home run .
" it was an off-speed pitch and i just tried to get a good swing on it and put it in play , " greer said . "
this was a big game .
the crowd was behind him and it was intense . "
the shot brought home ivan rodriguez , who had his second double of the game , giving him 42 this season , 41 as a catcher .

chris hoiles hit his 22nd homer for baltimore .
in new york , jason dickson scattered 10 hits over 6 1/3 innings in his major-league debut and chili davis belted a homer from each side of the plate as the california angels defeated the yankees 7-1 .

measles exposure can lead to bowel disease - study .
london 1996-08-23
women who get measles while pregnant may have babies at higher risk of crohn 's disease , a debilitating bowel disorder , researchers said on friday .
three out of four swedish babies born to mothers who caught measles developed serious cases of crohn 's disease , the researchers said .
dr andrew wakefield of the royal free hospital school of medicine and colleagues screened 25,000 babies delivered at university hospital , uppsala , between 1940 and 1949 .
four of the mothers had measles while pregnant .
" three of the four children had crohn 's disease , " wakefield 's group wrote in the lancet medical journal .
crohn 's is an inflammation of the bowel that can sometimes require surgery .
it causes diarrhoea , abdominal pain and weight loss .
the researchers said the three children involved had especially severe cases .
exposure to viruses can often cause birth defects .
most notably , women who get rubella ( german measles ) have a high risk of a stillborn baby .

garlic pills do n't lower cholesterol , study finds .
london 1996-08-22
garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , british researchers have reported .
a study by a team of doctors at oxford university has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets .
the study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels .
they were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . "
there were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the journal of the royal college of physicians .
those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period .
the researchers said this would make their findings more accurate .
several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol .
but the oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short .
the six-month trial was funded by the british heart foundation and lichtwer pharma gmbh , which makes kwai brand garlic tablets .
the study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol .

britain gives aid to volcano-hit caribbean island .
london 1996-08-22
britain said on thursday it would give 25 million pounds ( $ 39 million ) of development aid to the caribbean island of montserrat , where much of the population living in the south has fled to avoid a volcano .
the volcano in the soufriere hills has erupted three times in the past 13 months and last april some 4,500 people living in the capital , plymouth , and southern areas were evacuated to the north , where many are living in public shelters and schools .
" this assistance will provide a fast track development programme for the designated ( northern ) safe area , " britain 's overseas development administration said in a statement .
britain gave 8.5 million pounds ( $ 13 million ) to montserrat , which is one of its dependent territories , when the volcano first became active .
overseas development minister lynda chalker said a recent census had shown most montserratians wanted to remain on the island . "
the development of the north will help them to do just that , " she said .
tennis - philippoussis looms for sampras in u.s. open .
bill berkrot
new york 1996-08-22
world number one pete sampras , seeking his first grand slam title of the year , and women 's top seed steffi graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on monday .
sampras opens the defence of his u.s. open crown against david rikl of the czech republic , while top-ranked graf begins her title defence against yayuk basuki of indonesia .
wednesday 's u.s. open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round .
looming in sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis mark philippoussis , the rising australian who took out sampras in the third round of the australian open in january .
sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at wimbledon and their rubber match in new york could provide some first-week fireworks .
while only a stunning upset will keep graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed arantxa sanchez vicario , the german star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran natasha zvereva of belarus .
there will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked andre agassi landing in sampras 's half of the draw .
bumping agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into sampras as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis .
olympic champion agassi meets karim alami of morocco in the first round .
surprise second seed michael chang , ranked third in the world , opens against czech daniel vacek , while women 's second seed monica seles drew american anne miller as her first victim .
second-ranked austrian thomas muster , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him .
in the first round muster faces american richey reneberg , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late .
if he survives , muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded wimbledon champion richard krajicek of the netherlands or 12th-seeded american todd martin in the quarter-finals in chang 's half of the draw .
perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed jim courier against retiring star stefan edberg .
the popular swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's grand slam farewell could well be a one-match affair .
with the exception of a philippoussis showdown , sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of frenchman cedric pioline and ailing french open champion yevgeny kafelnikov , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path .
seles , runner-up to graf last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked german anke huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed conchita martinez or eighth-seeded olympic champion lindsay davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents .
but huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked south african amanda coetzer .
sanchez vicario , runner-up to graf at the french open and wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent martina hingis , the 16th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran jana novotna .
martinez begins play against ruxandra dragomir of romania .

rtrs - tennis - muster upset , philippoussis wins , stoltenberg loses .
toronto 1996-08-21
top-seeded thomas muster of austria was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked daniel nestor of canada on wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million canadian open .
a lefthander with a strong serve , nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds .
the tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded goran ivanisevic of croatia was beaten 6-7(3-7 ) 6-4 6-4 by unseeded mikael tillstrom of sweden .
other seeded players advancing were number three wayne ferreira of south africa , number four marcelo rios of chile , number six malivai washington of the united states and american todd martin , the seventh seeed .
eighth seed marc rosset of switzerland was eliminated in a one hour , 55 minute battle by unseeded mark philippoussis of australia .
philippoussis saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) .
philippoussis 's compatriot , 13th seed jason stoltenberg , was not as fortunate .
he held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 ( 7-1 ) 7-6 ( 13-11 ) by unseeded daniel vacek of the czech republic .
" i knew i had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what i was able to do , " said nestor , who ranks 10th in doubles .
there were only two service breaks in the match .
the lanky canadian broke muster at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the austrian hit a service return long .
" i probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said muster , only partly joking . "
the way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying i did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . "
" he played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . "
playing at night was not muster 's preference . "
i asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . "
i do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . "
ivanisevic rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot stefan edberg in the second round at wimbledon .
ivanisevic hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old tillstrom .
the sixth-ranked ivanisevic , who lost in the final at indianapolis to world number one pete sampras of the u.s. last sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " something was not there when i arrived ( in toronto ) .
i did n't feel good .
and i did n't have a good feeling as soon as i lost in my doubles ( on tuesday ) . "
" i thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said tillstrom .
the 19-year-old philippoussis , who beat sampras in the third round of this year 's australian open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against rosset .
" i 'm pleased because i did n't play that great today , but i fought really well , " he said . "
when i was down 2-5 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , i just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight .
then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back . "

dakar 1996-08-22
an outbreak of cholera has killed five people in the central senegal town of kaolack , where health authorities have recorded 291 cases since august 11 , a medical official said on thursday .
doctor masserigne ndiaye said medical staff were overwhelmed with work . "
people are rushing to the hospital as soon as the first symptoms appear , that 's why we have fewer deaths , " he told reuters by telephone from the town , 160 km ( 100 miles ) southeast of the senegalese capital dakar .
nigerian general takes over liberia ecomog force .
monrovia 1996-08-22
nigerian major general sam victor malu took over on thursday as commander of the ecomog peacekeeping force in liberia , two days after the start of the latest ceasefire in the six-year civil war .
malu replaced another nigerian major general , john inienger , who told officers at the handover ceremony that peace was now at hand for liberia after six years of fighting and more than a dozen failed accords .
" the search for peace in liberia has been difficult , challenging and sometimes painful .
peacekeepers were harassed , killed and taken hostage , " he said .
" it is difficult but i want to assure you that peace is in sight . "
united nations military observers travelling to the western town of tubmanburg on wednesday to monitor the ceasefire were delayed by shooting along the highway , u.n. special representative anthony nyakyi said .
they finally went ahead with an escort from the ulimo-j faction .
faction leaders who agreed a new peace deal in the nigerian capital abuja on saturday have accused each other of breaking the ceasefire .
the latest peace deal foresees the disarmament of an estimated 60,000 combatants and sets a target date of may 30 next year for elections .
the ecomog force , currently 10,000 strong , was sent to liberia by the economic community of west african states in 1990 at the height of the fighting .
guinea calls two days of prayer .
conakry 1996-08-22
the west african state of guinea declared thursday and friday days of national prayer .
a government statement , broadcast repeatedly by state radio , said the two days of prayer were " for the dead , for peace and prosperity in guinea , the victory of the new government and the health of the head of state " .
the precise reason for the call was not immediately clear .
guinea 's president , lansana conte , vice-president of the organisation of the islamic conference , left for kuwait on august 16 to prepare the next oic summit in pakistan in 1997 .
koranic reading sessions and prayers were to be held in the farming town of badi-tondon , near his home about 60 km ( 40 miles ) from the capital conakry .
conte , an army general , survived a february army pay revolt which at the time he described as a veiled attempt to topple him .
he has since named a prime minister for the first time since early in his rule and ordered a crackdown on corruption .
conte seized power in 1984 after the death of veteran marxist leader ahmed sekou toure .
he won elections in 1993 .

peru 's guerrillas kill one , take 8 hostage in jungle .
lima , peru 1996-08-21
peruvian guerrillas killed one man and took eight people hostage after taking over a village in the country 's northeastern jungle region , anti- terrorist police sources said on wednesday .
for three hours on tuesday , around 100 members of the maoist rebel group shining path took control of alomella robles , a small village about 345 miles ( 550 km ) northeast of lima , the sources said .
some guerrillas made villagers listen to propaganda speeches in the village centre , others forced passing motorists out of their cars and daubed their vehicles with slogans .
by wednesday , the whereabouts of the eight hostages was still not known , the sources said .
in recent months the shining path , severely weakened since the 1992 capture of its leader abimael guzman , has been stepping up both its military and propaganda activities .
peru 's guerrilla conflicts have cost at least 30,000 lives and $ 25 billion in damage to infrastructure since 1980 .
former surinam rebel leader held after shooting .
paramaribo , surinam 1996-08-21
flamboyant former surinamese rebel leader ronny brunswijk was in custody on wednesday charged with attempted murder , police said .
brunswijk turned himself into police after freddy pinas , a surinamese-born visitor from the netherlands , accused brunswijk of trying to kill him on sunday after a bar-room brawl in the small mining town of moengo , about 56 miles ( 90 km ) east of paramaribo , said police spokesman ro gajadhar .
pinas , showing cuts and bruises on his face , told reporters the former head of the feared jungle command had tried and failed to shoot him after pinas objected to brunswijk 's advances toward his wife .
pinas said brunswijk then ordered his bodyguards to beat him up .
brunswijk , 35 , denied the charges and said he had merely defended himself when pinas attacked him with a bottle .
it was the second time brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years .
in 1994 he served two months in prison for shooting a thief in the buttocks .
brunswijk led a rebel group of about 1,000 in a 1986 uprising against the regime of military strongman desi bouterse .
the conflict , which killed more than 500 and caused thousands to flee to neighbouring french guiana in the late 1980s , eventually paved the way to democratic elections in 1991 .
despite numerous problems with authorities , brunswijk went on to become a successful businessman with mining and logging interests .
he also manages and occasionally plays for one of the leading local soccer teams .
noisy saw leads thai police to heroin hideaway .

a hong kong carpenter was arrested in the thai seaside town of pattaya after police seized 18 kg ( 39.7 pounds ) of heroin following complaints by residents of a noisy saw , police said on thursday .
cheung siu man , 40 , was arrested late on wednesday after police searched a house and found heroin in bags and hidden in hollow spaces in wooden planks , police said .
the suspect said he was hired to make a wooden box from the planks in order to hide the heroin .
police went to the house after receiving complaints of sawing during the night over the course of several days .
when they arrived to investigate , police saw people escaping from the back door so they decided to search the house .
the seized heroin has an estimated street value of about 300 million baht ( $ 12 million ) , police said .
officials are now hunting for the suspect 's collaborators , police said .
cheung was being detained pending formal charges , police said .
australia foreign minister arrives in china .
beijing 1996-08-22
australian foreign minister alexander downer arrived in beijing on thursday for a four-day visit that follows rising friction between the two nations in recent weeks .
downer was to meet chinese foreign minister qian qichen and sign an agreement on an australian consulate in hong kong , an official of the australian embassy in beijing said .
china will resume sovereignty over hong kong , a british colony , in mid-1997 .
relations between china and australia have been strained in recent weeks because of australia 's plan to sell uranium to china 's rival taiwan .
other issues affecting ties include plans by an australian cabinet minister to visit taiwan , a security pact between canberra and washington and a possible visit to australia next month by tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the dalai lama .
downer is the first australian minister to visit china since the new conservative government took office in canberra in march .
palestinians accuse pa of banning books .
nablus , west bank 1996-08-22
a west bank bookseller charged on thursday that the palestinian information ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of israeli-plo self-rule deals .
" they made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action .
one official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to amman ' , " daoud makkawi , owner of the nablus-based al-risala bookshop , told reuters .
he said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from jordan of a book by edward said , a prominent scholar at new york city 's columbia university .
said , a u.s. citizen of palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 israeli-plo self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord .
on wednesday a bookseller in the west bank town of ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of said 's books on the israel-plo self-rule deals .
palestinian information ministry director-general mutawakel taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the palestinian authority has no plans to censor books .
" there is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " taha told reuters .
but taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials .
" this may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said .
daoud said books by other authors , including british journalist patrick seale , were also banned .
he said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books .
" i think this is a bad beginning .
if we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "
daoud said .
thousands of books were banned from sale in the west bank and gaza strip by the israeli military authorities before the jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the plo under a self-rule deal in 1994 .
egypt blames istanbul control tower for accident .
cairo 1996-08-22
the chairman of national carrier egyptair on thursday blamed the control tower at istanbul airport for the egyptair plane accident .
twenty people were injured on wednesday when the egyptair boeing 707 overshot the runway , caught fire , hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line .
chairman mohamed fahim rayyan told a news conference at cairo airport : " the control tower should have allocated the plane another runway , instead of the one the plane landed on . "
" the one it landed on is 2,250 metres ( 2,460 yards ) long while the other one if more than 3,000 metres ( 3,300 yards ) long and is less steep , " he added .
he said a turkish civil aviation authority official had made the same point and he noted that a turkish plane had a similar accident there in 1994 .
the egyptair pilot blamed turkish airport staff for misleading him .
the landing took place after a rainstorm .
" its not an accident .
it 's very wet .
the brake action is very poor and the tower said it 's medium .
that 's wrong , " the pilot told private ihlas news agency in english .
egypt wants nothing to do with sudanese rulers .
cairo 1996-08-22
the egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support egyptian militants , president hosni mubarak said in a speech on thursday .
egypt says the sudanese government helped the moslem militants who tried to kill mubarak in addis ababa last year .
it sponsored last week 's u.n. security council resolution threatening a ban on sudanese flights abroad if khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the addis ababa incident .
the sanctions will come into effect in november if sudan fails to extradite the men , but sudan says it cannot hand them over to ethiopia for trial because they are not in sudan .
" we are still eager that nothing should affect the sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the turabi front or whatever , " mubarak told a group of academics .
hassan al-turabi is the leader of the national islamic front , the political force behind the sudanese government .
" i do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter .
there are terrorists they are sheltering and they make sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " mubarak said .
he did not say if egypt would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary sudanese .

miss universe hides behind veil of silence .
kieran murray
las cruces , n.m. 1996-08-22
miss universe , venezuela 's alicia machado , left new mexico on thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title .
machado , 19 , flew to los angeles after slipping away from the new mexico desert town of las cruces , where she attended the 1996 miss teen usa pageant on wednesday .
while machado was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by los angeles-based miss universe inc. to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown .
in venezuela , her mother told reuters that machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted .
marta fajardo insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the miss universe title in las vegas in may , had perfectly normal eating habits .
" everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said .
organisers flatly denied ever threatening machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her .
dressed in a black strapless evening gown at wednesday 's pageant , machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage .
" are you kidding ?
she 's fantastic , " said nikki campbell , 28 , who went to the pageant . "
she looked great .
very sexy . "
machado 's publicists said on thursday she was scheduled to stay in los angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to venezuela on sept .
5 .
beauty queens are high-profile personalities in venezuela and machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week .
it was an official of the miss venezuela organisation who first said machado had been told to lose weight fast .
people close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat .
martin brooks , president of miss universe inc , said he spoke with machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her .
" she 's fine with it .
she wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific .
there 's no problem whatsoever , " he told reuters .
he said the lifestyle associated with being miss universe could make routine exercise difficult .
" the problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist .
i dont know if alicia is working out .
we have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue , " he said .

it was his second assisted-suicide in 36 hours and the 37th that he has acknowledged attending since starting his crusade for doctor assisted suicide in 1990 .
kevorkian 's lawyer , geoffrey fieger , said those attending smith 's death included her husband , david , a police officer , her father , james poland , and kevorkian .

defiant u.s. neo-nazi jailed by german court .
andrew gray
hamburg , germany 1996-08-22
a hamburg court sentenced u.s. neo-nazi leader gary lauck on thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into germany from his base in the united states .
lauck , from lincoln , nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .
" the struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in german before being escorted out by security guards .
lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under german law .
the german government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-nazism .
lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-semitic propaganda material flowing into germany since the 1970s .
" lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge guenter bertram told the court .
" he set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at germany . "
said bertram , who also read out extracts from lauck 's material praising hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the nazi slaughter of millions of jews as a myth .
eager to put lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor bernd mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 .
he had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence .
publishing and distributing neo-nazi material is illegal in germany but lauck 's defence team had argued that u.s freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland .
interior minister manfred kanther said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " .
" it is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition social democrats said in a statement .
lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision .
but as lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .
" neither the national socialists ( nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an american citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to germany from denmark . "
that 's the truth . "
his attorney , hans-otto sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a german court could judge someone for actions carried out in the united states .
bertram said lauck was obsessed by nazism and devoted his life to leading his national socialist german workers ' party foreign organisation ( nsdap-ao ) , which derives its name from the full german title of hitler 's nazi party .
during the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the nsdap-ao 's " ns kampfruf " ( " national socialist battle cry " ) magazine , filled with references to aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about jews .
the court rejected sieg 's argument that lauck 's extradition from denmark , where he was arrested in march last year at the request of german authorities , was illegal .
lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .
he will probably be free in around two and a half years .
the court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .

suspected killers of bishop dead -- algeria tv .
paris 1996-08-22
algerian security forces have shot dead three moslem guerrillas suspected of killing a leading french bishop in western algeria , the algerian state-run television said on thursday .
security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain moslem rebels , the television said .
the television , which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels , said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the french roman catholic bishop pierre claverie .
the 58-year-old claverie was killed in august 1 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western algerian city of oran , hours after he met visiting french foreign minister herve de charette in algiers .
an estimated 50,000 algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in algeria 's violence pitting moslem rebels against the algerian government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical islamists took a commanding lead .

clinton 's ballybunion fans invited to chicago .
dublin 1996-08-22
u.s. president bill clinton had to drop the resort of ballybunion from a whirlwind irish tour last year .
so ballybunion is going to america instead .
two residents of the atlantic resort , where clinton was to have played golf with the irish foreign minister dick spring , have been invited to the democratic party convention in chicago on august 26-29 .
they have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when clinton addressed ireland at a packed ceremony in dublin city centre on december 1 , last year .
they read : " ballybunion backs clinton . "
" the democratic party have requested we bring our placards with us .
we will be guests of the kennedys , " said frank quilter , one of the two who have been invited to chicago .
clinton made a triumphant irish tour to back a northern ireland peace process but was forced to drop ballybunion from a packed schedule at the last minute .
bonn says moscow has promised to observe ceasefire .
bonn 1996-08-22
germany said on thursday it had received assurances from the russian government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in chechnya .
foreign ministry spokesman martin erdmann said top bonn diplomat wolfgang ischinger had been assured by senior russian officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the chechen capital of grozny was not valid .
" the russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " erdmann told reuters after speaking by telephone to ischinger , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to moscow .
he returned to bonn on thursday .
ischinger is the political director of bonn 's foreign ministry .
ischinger said he met three russian deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister , who confirmed russian foreign minister yevgeny primakov 's pledge that moscow would seek a political solution under the aegis of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) .
" the ultimatum ( to storm grozny ) is no longer an issue , " he said quoting ischinger , who had been sent to moscow by german foreign minister klaus kinkel as his personal envoy to urge an end to moscow 's military campaign in the breakaway region .
ischinger said the threat of a major assault to take grozny had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not moscow 's intention .
the officials had been positive about kinkel 's request on wednesday that president boris yeltsin 's security chief alexander lebed should , on his return to moscow , meet tim goldiman , the osce representative responsible for chechnya , he said .
india says sees no arms race with china , pakistan .
new delhi 1996-08-22
india said on thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean new delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring pakistan and china .
foreign minister i.k. gujral was asked at a news conference if india 's decision to block adoption of the accord in geneva would lead to an arms race with pakistan and china .
" i do n't see that possibility because india is not entering into any arms race , " he said . "
our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . "
china , along with britain , france , russia and the united states , is a declared nuclear power .
india carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb .
experts believe both india and pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons .
gujral said he did not expect india 's veto of the comprehensive test ban treaty ( ctbt ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations .
" i do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country .
the text has already been blocked , " he said .
gujral said india would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified .
asked what india would do if the pact were forwarded to the united nations general assembly , gujral said : " that bridge i will cross when i come to it . "
in a written statement released at the news conference , gujral reiterated india 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the conference on disarmament in geneva .
" it is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said .
gujral said india had national security concerns that made it impossible for new delhi to sign the ctbt .
" our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that india had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 1974 .
he said : " we cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " .
britain says death of its citizen will sour ties .
dhaka 1996-08-22
a british minister expressed his government 's official disquiet on thursday at the recent death of a british citizen of bangladeshi origin at dhaka airport .
" i have told bangladesh leaders that british goverment has attached serious importance to the resolution of the tragic death of siraj mia , " under-secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs liam fox fox , told reporters .
siraj mia died at dhaka airport on may 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from london .
his body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered .
a post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured .
but customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet .
fox , who arrived in bangladesh on tuesday on four-day visit , said britain wanted dhaka to act seriously on the case .
" this is one of the reasons of my visit here ...
this is an important issue in our relationship " , said fox , who is due to leave for nepal on friday .
fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments .
he said the mia 's issue had been raised in the house of commons .
fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in dhaka .
he said the bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously .
" the british government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , " he said .
fox said the british government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at dhaka airport by customs officials .
bangladesh 's criminal investigation department has charged two immigration officials in connection with mia 's killing .
mia , a father of five children , had a restaurant business in a london suburb .
india fears attempts to disrupt kashmir polls .
srinagar , india 1996-08-22
india 's home ( interior ) minister accused pakistan on on thursday of planning to disrupt state elections in troubled jammu and kashmir state .
" it seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections , " inderjit gupta told reporters in the state capital srinagar .
the local polls next month will be the first since 1987 in the state , clamped under direct rule from new delhi since 1990 .
india has often accused pakistan of abetting militancy in the valley , a charge islamabad has always denied .
gupta said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the kashmir valley to create disturbance in the region .
" we noticed among the people who come from across the border , there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries , " gupta said .
india and pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the troubled region of kashmir since independence from britain in 1947 .
prime minister h.d. deve gowda 's centre-left government hopes the elections will help restore normality and democratic rule in jammu and kashmir , where more than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence since 1990 .
over a dozen militant groups are fighting new delhi 's rule in the state .

india rbi chief sees cut in cash reserve ratio .
new delhi 1996-08-22
the reserve bank of india governor c. rangarajan said on thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( crr ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term .
" over the medium term , yes , " he told reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital .
he denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the crr could be raised if necessary .
he said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the crr by central banks to manage money supply .
rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio .
but in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question .

two pct india current account deficit viable - rbi .
bombay 1996-08-22
the reserve bank of india governor chakravarty rangarajan said on thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth .
" the current account deficit of around two percent of gdp is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " rangarajan said in an address to business leaders in new delhi .
rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 16-17 percent annual growth in exports and a 14-15 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 20 percent over the next five years .

mother teresa devoted to world 's poor .
calcutta 1996-08-22
mother teresa , known as the saint of the gutters , won the nobel peace prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " the poor must know that we love them . "
while the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of albanian descent maintains she is merely doing god 's work .
" it gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . "
the poor do not need our sympathy and pity .
they need our love and compassion . "
the diminutive roman catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an indian nursing home on thursday after suffering heart failure .
but an attending doctor said mother teresa , who turns 86 next tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition .
the task mother teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world .
when in 1979 she was told she had won the nobel peace prize , she said characteristically : " i am unworthy . "
the world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the bharat ratna , or jewel of india , the country 's highest civilian award .
her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker .
a year later , the vatican announced she was stepping down as superior of her missionaries of charity order .
more than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor .
they could not agree , so asked her to stay on .
she agreed .
in 1991 , mother teresa was treated at a california hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia .
in 1993 , she fell in rome and broke three ribs .
in august the same year , while in new delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems .
last april she fractured her left collar bone .
but her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate .
mother teresa was born agnes goinxha bejaxhiu to albanian parents in skopje , in what was then serbia , on august 27 , 1910 .
she attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 .
at the age of 18 she became a loretto nun , hoping to work at the order 's calcutta mission .
she was sent to loretto abbey in dublin and from there to india to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in calcutta .
she said her divine call to work among the poor came in september , 1946 . "
the message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . "
i was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them .
it was an order .
i knew where i belonged . "
the vatican and the mother superior in dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with american missionaries she opened her first calcutta slum school in december 1949 .
she took the name of teresa , after france 's saint therese of the child jesus .
in india she was simply called mother .
mother teresa set up her first home for the dying in a hindu rest house in calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital .
named " nirmal hriday " ( tender heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year .
her missionaries of charity , a roman catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in india and abroad .
in 1994 a british television documentary called the myth around mother teresa a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " .
catholics around the world rose to her defence .
rtrs - focus-news forecasts alien-led profit boost .
bernard hickey
sydney 1996-08-22
media baron rupert murdoch 's news corp ltd reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on thursday , but forecast that the hit film " independence day " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 .
" from an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' independence day , ' " news corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to june 30 , 1996 .
it said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its fox broadcasting television network in the united states would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . "
a budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " news corp said .
the bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 .
news announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to a$ 1.26 billion ( us$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents .
analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of a$ 1.343 billion .
" the year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " first pacific media analyst lachlan drummond said .
news corp said strong performances in u.s. television and british newspapers were offset by lower profits from news corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its asian star tv operations .
higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "
throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over us$ 300 million , " it said .
news corp said british newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at the sun and the times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs .
advertising revenues at the times grew 20 percent .
analysts said sharply lower earnings from news corp 's book publishing division and its u.s. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 .
news corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the u.s. tv guide .
news said dramatically lower earnings from the british arm of its harper-collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its u.s. operation .
it said the demise of the net book agreement had hurt the british operations , and weak performances from the san francisco unit of harper-collins had not helped .
the minimum price setting expired last september when three publishers pulled out .
but it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement .
" if they 're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one sydney media analyst who declined to be named .
news corp 's shares were down eight cents at a$ 6.39 at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 gmt ) in a soft market .

rtrs - budget cuts to boost australia savings - rba .
canberra 1996-08-22
the australian government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings , the reserve bank of australia ( rba ) said in its annual report .
" the government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the rba said .
the bank said there were concerns fiscal consolidation would unduly restrict growth , but evidence was ambiguous .
in its 1996/97 budget announced on tuesday , the australian coalition government announced an underlying budget deficit of a$ 5.65 billion , and pledged to return the underlying budget balance to surplus by 1998/99 .
the budget deficit was a$ 10.3 billion in 1995/96 .
-- sydney newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
" determined and credible efforts to rein in unsustainable fiscal positions ( are ) often rewarded by rising confidence , giving favourable effects on economic activity even in the short term , " it said .
" more generally , the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive , with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates , " the rba said .

ukraine hails peace as marks five-year independence .

kiev 1996-08-23
ukraine celebrates five years of independence from kremlin rule on saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-soviet achievement .
ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in december of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from moscow .
ukraine , with a russian community of 11 million people -- the world 's largest outside russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in russia 's chechnya , neighbouring moldova , and the former soviet republics of georgia , azerbaijan and tajikistan .
" ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " president leonid kuchma said in televised statement this week .
" unlike many other post-soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . "
but independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround .
inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in june and july and the economy has just begun to grow .
kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the ukraina palace on friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future .
" there is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said adelbert knobl , head of the international monetary fund 's mission in ukraine . "
the national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . "
central bank officials said on thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year .
it will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble .
ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems .
proud of its record in promptly joining both the council of europe and nato 's partnership for peace , ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending china by allowing a taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit .
china cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest .
kiev 's foreign minister hennady udovenko said beijing was overreacting .
but ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between russia and the rapidly westernising countries of eastern europe , is looking west as well as east .
" the strategic aim of european integration should not in any way damage ukraine 's interests in post-soviet areas .
relations with russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , " kuchma said .
" but ukraine cannot be economically oriented on russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . "
kuchma has said kiev wants membership of the european union , associate membership of the western european union defence grouping and to move closer to nato .
a message from the west this week from u.s. president bill clinton congratulated ukraine on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising ukraine as a " stabilising factor " in a united europe .
oldest albania book disappears from vatican - paper .
tirana 1996-08-23
a 16th-century document , the earliest complete example of written albanian , has disappeared from the vatican archives , an albanian newspaper said on friday .
gazeta shqiptare said the " book of mass ' , by gjon buzuku , dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in rome , was the first major document published in the albanian language .
" we albanians , sons of buzuku , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar musa hamiti , told of the loss by the vatican library .
tirana 's national library has three copies of the " book of mass ' . "
there is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies , " gazeta shqiptare said .
russia to clamp down on barter deals .
moscow 1996-08-23
russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on friday .
" we have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from russia , " marina volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the state customs committee , told reuters .
volkova said last year goods had been exported under many russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return .
she said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 .
barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said .
" the cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " volkova said .
a few days ago russian president boris yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and volkova said this " could substantially improve the situation " .
in line with the decree , which will come into force on november 1 , all russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days .
" if traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " volkova said .
understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " .
barter has always been a feature of the soviet union 's foreign trade , but yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus .
a few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable russian banks and money transfer systems " , volkova said .
" now many russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones .
but the current share of barter deals in russian exports is still high , " she said .

viacom plans " mission " sequel - report .
los angeles 1996-08-22
paramount pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the tom cruise blockbuster , " mission : impossible " and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 , daily variety reported in its friday edition .
the big-screen version of the spy tv series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening may 22 , and $ 338 million overseas so far .
it 's the biggest success for viacom inc-owned paramount since 1994 's " forrest gump " .
however , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible .
cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet academy award-winning screenwriter william goldman , who will write the script , the report said .
it said " mission : impossible " director brian de palma would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet .
goldman , whose oscars were for " butch cassidy and the sundance kid " and " all the president 's men " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters .
however , he singled out " mission : impossible " as an especially entertaining movie , daily variety said .
cricket - crawley forced to sit and wait .
london 1996-08-23
england batsman john crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against pakistan on friday .
heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time ( 1315 gmt ) start in the event of no further rain .
crawley , unbeaten on 94 overnight in an england total of 278 for six , was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the oval ground staff took centre stage .
there were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time ( 1130 gmt ) .
when brighter weather finally arrived , the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time ( 1800 gmt ) .

soccer - sponsors cash in on ravanelli 's shirt dance .
london 1996-08-23
middlesbrough 's italian striker fabrizio ravanelli is to wear his team sponsor 's name on the inside of his shirt so it can be seen when he scores .
every time he finds the net , the grey-haired forward pulls his shirtfront over his head as he runs to salute the fans , and middlesbrough 's sponsors want to cash in on the spectacle .
" having seen ravanelli celebrate his goals ...
we thought it would be fun to have ( the name ) on the inside of his shirt , " a spokesman for the sponsors said .
" it will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest . "
ravanelli aggravated a foot injury in the 1-0 defeat at chelsea on wednesday and was given only an even chance of playing at nottingham forest on saturday by his manager bryan robson .
tennis - australians advance at canadian open .
toronto 1996-08-22
it was australia day at the $ 2 million canadian open on thursday as three aussies reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories .
unseeded patrick rafter recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded american malivai washington 6-2 6-1 in just 50 minutes .
todd woodbridge , who defeated canadian daniel nestor 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 7-6 ( 7-4 ) , and mark philippoussis , a 6-3 6-4 winner over bohdan ulihrach of the czech republic , also advanced and will meet in friday 's quarter-finals .
third-seeded wayne ferreira of south africa defeated tim henman of britain 6-4 6-4 after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded thomas enqvist of sweden won his third-round match , eliminating petr korda of the czech republic 6-3 6-4 .
ferreira and enqvist play in a friday night quarter-final .
two americans , seventh seed todd martin and unseeded alex o'brien , will meet on friday after winning matches on thursday .
martin overcame cedric pioline of france 2-6 6-2 6-4 and o'brien beat mikael tillstrom of sweden 6-3 2-6 6-3 .
" if you really look at the match , " said the 12th-ranked washington after losing to the 70th-ranked rafter , " i never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net .
" he was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the 40s .
put those two things together and you get a loss . "
rafter missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective .
" before when i was on tour , i always felt i had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and i had to be up at a certain time , " rafter said . "
now i can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning .
i just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . "
martin was pleased with his victory over pioline , his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked frenchman . "
it 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said .
" i got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because cedric definitely went off a little bit . "
the 26-year-old o'brien , who won the atp tour stop in new haven last week , has now won 18 of his last 20 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in los angeles in late july .
he ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago .
" i feel i 'm hitting the ball well even though i 'm having more mental letdowns than i did last week , " o'brien said . "
but i 'm still competing well . "
" i got a lot of first serves in , " said enqvist about his victory over korda . "
i did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . "
still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against javier sanchez of spain on tuesday , enqvist joked , " today against petr there were about 64 strokes in the whole match .
it was mostly short points . "

rugby union - mulder out of second test .
johannesburg 1996-08-23
centre japie mulder has been ruled out of south africa 's team for the second test against new zealand in pretoria on saturday .
mulder missed the first test in durban with back spasms and failed a fitness check on thursday .
but new springbok skipper gary teichmann has recovered from a bruised thigh and is ready to play , coach andre markgraaff said .
mulder 's absence means that northern transvaal centre andre snyman should win his second cap alongside provincial colleague danie van schalkwyk .
wing pieter hendriks is expected to retain his place , following speculation that snyman would be picked out of position on the wing .
the line-up would not be announced until shortly before the start , markgraaff said .

tennis - injured chanda rubin out of u.s. open .
new york 1996-08-23
promising 10th-ranked american chanda rubin has pulled out of the u.s. open tennis championships with a wrist injury , tournament officials announced .
the 20-year-old rubin , who was to be seeded 11th , is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months .
rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded olympic champion lindsay davenport .
davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 17th-ranked karina habsudova of slovakia .
but as the highest-ranked non-seeded player in the tournament , habsudova will be moved into rubin 's slot in the draw , while davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round , according to u.s. tennis association officials .
rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 12th-ranked former australian open champion mary pierce and 20th-ranked wimbledon semifinalist meredith mcgrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries .
men 's australian open champion boris becker will also miss the year 's final grand slam with a wrist injury .

baseball - sorrento hits slam as seattle routs orioles .
baltimore 1996-08-22
former oriole jamie moyer allowed two hits over eight scoreless innings before tiring in the ninth and paul sorrento added his third grand slam of the season as the seattle mariners routed baltimore 10-3 thursday .
moyer ( 10-2 ) , who was tagged for a pair of homers by mike devereaux and brady anderson and three runs in the ninth , walked none and struck out two .
norm charlton retired the final three batters to seal the victory .
with one out in the fifth ken griffey jr and edgar martinez stroked back-to-back singles off orioles starter rocky coppinger ( 7-5 ) and jay buhner walked .
sorrento followed by hitting a 1-2 pitch just over the right-field wall for a 7-0 advantage .
right fielder bobby bonilla was after the ball , which was touched by fans at the top of the scoreboard in right .
" things fell in for us , " said sorrento , who has six career grand slams and hit the ninth of the season for the mariners .
" we have over a month left .
we 've got to make up some ground . "
in the american league wild-card race , the mariners are three games behind the white sox , two behind baltimore and two ahead of the red sox heading into boston for a weekend series .
moyer retired 11 straight batters between the third and seventh innings and threw two or fewer pitches to 11 of the 29 batters he faced .
" i made some bad pitches at the end but i 'm not going to dwell on it .
we won the game , " said moyer .
coppinger ( 7-5 ) was tagged for eight runs and 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings .
orioles manager davey johnson missed the game after being admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat .
bench coach andy etchebarren took his place .
in boston , troy o'leary homered off the right-field foul pole with one out in the bottom of the ninth and the red sox climbed to the .500 mark for the first time this season with their fourth straight victory , 2-1 over the oakland athletics .
boston has won 15 of its last 19 games .
boston 's roger clemens ( 7-11 ) was one out away from his second straight shutout when pinch-hitter matt stairs tripled over the head of centre fielder lee tinsley on an 0-2 pitch and pinch-hitter terry steinbach dunked a broken-bat single into right to lift oakland into a 1-1 tie .
the run broke clemens ' 28-inning shutout streak , longest in the majors this season .
he pitched his fourth complete game , allowing eight hits with two walks and 11 strikeouts .
reliever mark acre ( 0-1 ) took the loss .
in new york , garret anderson and gary disarcina drove in two runs apiece in a five-run first inning and jim edmonds highlighted a six-run sixth with a bases-loaded double as the california angels coasted to a 12-3 victory over the yankees in the rubber game of their three-game series .
the angels battered kenny rogers ( 10-7 ) for five runs in the first .
the yankees have allowed at least two runs in the first inning in six straight games , getting outscored 21-1 in the first inning in that span .
chuck finley ( 12-12 ) snapped a four-game losing streak .
in kansas city , travis fryman doubled in the go-ahead run in the fifth and melvin nieves and damion easley belted two-run homers as the detroit tigers claimed a 10-3 win over the royals , handing them their fifth straight loss .
the tigers won their third straight and halted a seven-game road losing streak behind justin thompson ( 1-2 ) , who earned his first major-league win .
tim belcher ( 12-8 ) was tagged for six runs and nine hits in eight innings .
at minnesota , ken hill allowed two runs en route to his sixth complete game of the season and rusty greer added three hits , including a homer , and two rbi as the red-hot texas rangers routed the twins 11-2 .
the rangers , who won for the 11th time in their last 13 games , have scored 45 runs in their last five contests .

athletics - masterkova breaks second world record in 10 days .

brussels 1996-08-23
russia 's double olympic champion svetlana masterkova smashed her second world record in just 10 days on friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's 1,000 metres .
after breaking the world record for the women 's mile in zurich last wednesday , the olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over 1,000 at the brussels grand prix meeting .
the russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by mozambique 's maria mutola in the same stadium in august last year .
former world 800 champion mutola pushed masterkova all the way , finishing second in 2:29.66 .
but it was the russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd .
masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent atlanta games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break .
in her first mile race at the richest meeting in zurich last wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record .
the record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in zurich earned masterkova a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold .
after friday 's performance the russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account .
brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the atlanta games but put down on a softer surface .
masterkova clearly enjoyed it .
mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .

athletics - mitchell upstages trio of olympic sprint champions .
adrian warner
brussels 1996-08-23
american dennis mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present olympic 100 metres champions on friday with a storming victory at the brussels grand prix .
sporting his customary bright green outfit , the u.s. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of canada 's reigning olympic champion donovan bailey , 1992 champion linford christie of britain and american 1984 and 1988 champion carl lewis .
mitchell also beat world and olympic champion bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in zurich last week .
the american , who finished fourth at the atlanta games , was fast out of his blocks and held off bailey 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration .
the canadian was second in 10.09 with lewis third in 10.10 , ahead of atlanta bronze medallist ato boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth .
christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 .
lewis , making a rare appearance in europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp .
american olympic high hurdles champion allen johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by britain 's colin jackson .
johnson ran the same time at the u.s. olympic trials in atlanta in june to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with american roger kingdom .
he seemed to relish the new track at the brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back .
jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds .
the rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race .
but sweden 's olympic high hurdles champion ludmila engquist , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds .
olympic silver medallist brigita bukovec of slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 .
jamaican commonwealth champion michelle freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of cuban aliuska lopez .
the zurich fall cost engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the golden four series in oslo , zurich , brussels and berlin .
seven athletes went into friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and american men 's 400 metres hurdles champion derrick adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 .
american olympic champion gail devers clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in atlanta .
jamaican veteran merlene ottey , who beat devers in zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 .
american world champion gwen torrence , the bronze medallist in atlanta , was second in 11.00 .
it was a costly defeat for ottey since it threw her out of the race for the golden four jackpot .

sri lanka and australia agreed on friday that relations between the two teams had healed since the sri lankans ' acrimonious tour last year .
the sri lankans were first found guilty then cleared of ball tampering and off-spinner muttiah muralitharan was called for throwing during a controversial three-test series in australia .
" our concern is to get out there and play proper cricket , " sri lanka captain arjuna ranatunga told a news conference on the eve of a warmup match between the world cup champions and a world xi team scheduled for saturday .
" what happened is history . "
australian team manager cam battersby said he agreed with ranatunga .
" i believe relations between the two teams will be excellent , " batterby said .
the australians are making their first visit to the indian ocean island since boycotting a world cup fixture in february after a terrorist bomb in colombo .

the tournament , starting on august 26 , also includes india and zimbabwe .
battersby said he was satisfied with the security arrangements .
sri lankan officials said they expected heavy rain which washed out a warmup match on friday should cease by saturday .

colombia , u.s. reach aviation agreement .
miami 1996-08-23
the u.s. and colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow amr corp 's american airlines to operate three round-trip flights between new york and bogota , the department of transportation said friday .
under the agreement , which followed talks in miami this week , amr also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between miami and colombia to its new york gateway .
the united states also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years .
colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current new york service , although it will not be able to do so while under category two ( conditional ) status under the federal aviation administration 's international aviation safety program .
colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said .
with the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said .
the agreement resolved a dispute that arose in june when colombia turned down american 's request to operate flights between new york and bogota , a denial that prompted the united states to charge that the colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two colombian airlines , avianca and aces .

rtrs - golf : norman sacks his coach after disappointing season .
sydney 1996-08-23
world number one golfer greg norman has sacked his coach butch harmon after a disappointing season .
" butch and i are finished , " norman told reporters on thursday before the start of the world series of golf in akron , ohio .
norman , a two-time british open champion , parted ways with his long-time mentor after drawing a blank in this year 's four majors , winning two tournaments worldwide .
the blonde australian opened with a level par round of 70 in akron , leaving him four shots adrift of the leaders , americans billy mayfair and paul goydos and japan 's hidemichi tanaki .
on wednesday norman described this year as his worst on the professional circuit since 1991 , when he failed to win a tournament .
" my application this year has been strange , " norman said . "
maybe i have n't been as keyed up as i should have been . "
" sometimes you do n't have it in your head to play .
maybe this was one of those years where i was there , but i was n't 100 percent there , and you have to be 100 percent to perform , " he said .

soccer - arab team breaks new ground in israel .
ori lewis
taibe , israel 1996-08-23
for the first time in israeli history , an arab team will take the field when the national league soccer season starts on saturday .
hapoel taibe fields four jewish players and two foreign imports -- a pole and a romanian .
the rest of the side is made up mainly of moslem arabs .
the club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in taibe , an arab town of 28,000 in the heart of israel .
but away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse .
" the very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against betar jerusalem , " said taibe supporter karem haj yihye .
two weeks ago taibe , coached by pole wojtek lazarek , met betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing likud party , for the first time in a cup match in jerusalem .
chants from the crowd of " death to the arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw .
one taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium .
" we 're used to hearing the taunts of " death to the arabs ' , " said sameh haj yihye , a taibe resident who studies at jerusalem 's hebrew university . "
but we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . "
the dusty town of taibe lacks the amenities of jewish communities and many israeli arabs have long complained of state discrimination .
" there are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to tel aviv , " 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , sameh haj yihye said .
the town 's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks .
" we plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman abdul rahman haj yihye . "
we will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . "
in the meantime , taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the jewish coastal town of netanya .
" we are israelis , there is no question about that , " said karem haj yihye , a hotel waiter .
" we do n't have any connection with the palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the west bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east .
" we do n't feel our club represents palestinian arabs , " said club chairman abdul rahman . "
we are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole arab world . "

soccer - manchester united face juventus in europe .
geneva 1996-08-23
european champions juventus will face english league and cup double winners manchester united in this season 's european champions ' league .
the draw made on friday pitted juventus , who beat dutch champions ajax amsterdam 4-2 on penalties in last year 's final , against alex ferguson 's european hopefuls in group c .
the other two teams in the group are last season 's cup winners ' cup runners-up rapid vienna and fenerbahce of turkey .
juventus meet united in turin on september 11 , with the return match at old trafford on november 20 .
united have dominated the premier league in the 1990s , winning three english championships in four years , but have consistently failed in europe , crashing out of the european cup to galatasaray of turkey and spain 's barcelona at their last two attempts .
they have not lifted a european trophy since 1991 when they beat barcelona in the cup winners ' cup final , and their one and only european cup triumph was way back in 1968 , when they beat benfica of portugal 4-1 at wembley .
juventus have won the european cup twice .
before conquering ajax last year they beat united 's big english rivals liverpool in the ill-fated 1985 final in the heysel stadium in brussels .

orthodox church blown up in southern croatia .
zagreb 1996-08-23
saboteurs blew up a serb orthodox church in southern croatia on friday with a blast which also damaged four nearby homes , the state news agency hina reported .

it did not report any casualties .
zadar police said in a statement they had launched an investigation and were doing their best to find the perpetrators .
hina said it was the first time an orthodox church had been blown up in the zadar hinterland , where a large number of serbs lived before the 1991 war over croatia 's independence from the yugoslav federation .
the area was part of the self-styled state of krajina proclaimed by minority serbs in 1991 and recaptured by the croatian army last year .
up to 200,000 serbs fled to bosnia and yugoslavia , leaving krajina vacant and depopulated .

russians , chechens say observing grozny ceasefire .
grozny , russia 1996-08-23
rebel fighters and russian soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon ( 0800 gmt ) on friday was being generally observed , although scattered gunfire echoed through the chechen capital grozny .
the russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on thursday .
" there has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter aslan shabazov , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers .
soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured russian t-72 tank roared out to investigate .
the separatists , who swept into grozny on august 6 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads .
" the ceasefire is being observed , " said woman soldier svetlana goncharova , 35 , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap .
a few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air .
the truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on thursday between russian peacemaker alexander lebed and rebel chief-of-staff aslan maskhadov .
the two also agreed to set up joint patrols in grozny , but goncharova said she was sceptical about whether this could work .
" we have to try it , but i doubt if this is possible with the separatists , " she said .

yugoslavia and croatia were poised on friday to sign a landmark normalisation treaty ending five years of tensions and paving way for stabilisation in the balkans .
croatian foreign minister mate granic landed at belgrade airport aboard a croatian government jet on friday morning for talks with his yugoslav counterparts and a signing ceremony expected around noon ( 1000 gmt ) .

jordan expels iraqi diplomat after bread riots .
rana sabbagh
amman 1996-08-23
jordan , which has blamed iraq for bread riots last week , has asked an iraqi diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on friday .
the main friday prayers in southern jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported .
adel ibrahim , the iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told reuters , implying he was accused of spying .
ibrahim told reuters by telephone from his embassy office in amman that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order .
the government declined official comment .
ibrahim 's assistant , hussein khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after king hussein began calling for change in baghdad following top iraqi defections in august 1995 .
iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the jordanian embassy in baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world .
jordan has accused iraq and a local pro-baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the international monetary fund .
in karak , where two days of riots flared last friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside omari mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 15 minutes .
" disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers .
the men shouted " allahu akbar " ( god is greatest ) as a former islamist deputy , ahmed kafawin , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble .
he had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises .
armoured cars had patrolled streets in karak , traditional bastion of communist ideology and baath socialism that swept the region in the 1950s , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its crusader castle before the prayers .
there was also heavy security in the crowded centre of amman , where smaller clashes had erupted last saturday , but friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on .
the jordanian arab socialist baath party , which has one deputy in the 80-seat lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .
government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships .
turkey says killed 17 kurd rebels in clashes .
ankara 1996-08-23
turkish troops have killed 17 kurdish rebels in recent clashes in the southeast of the country , the state-run anatolian news agency said on friday .
two security officials and two state-paid village guards were killed in the fighting with kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) guerrillas , the agency quoted the emergency rule governor 's office as saying .
eight of the rebels were killed in van province , five in sirnak and four in hakkari .
the agency did not say when the clashes took place .
more than 20,000 people have died in the pkk 's 12-year-old fight for independence or autonomy in southeastern turkey .
three people , including two village guards , died when a mine planted by pkk rebels exploded on a road in the southeast , anatolian reported earlier .
it said a taxi carrying the guards , members of a mostly kurdish militia which fights the pkk , hit the mine in the province of diyarbakir .
u.s. says iraqi kurds agree ceasefire .
washington 1996-08-23
leaders of iraq 's two main kurdish factions agreed on friday to end six days of fighting and to attend u.s.-mediated peace talks next month , the state department said .
spokesman glyn davies said in a statement that the agreement followed direct u.s. contacts with massoud barzani , leader of the kurdistan democratic party ( kdp ) , and jalal talabani , leader of the patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) .
davies said the two leaders " have agreed to cease the fighting ( and ) return their forces to the positions held before the current fighting began " on august 17 .
he did not give a specific time for the ceasefire but said the united states looked forward to " immediate implementation " .
the two party leaders had also agreed to meet u.s. assistant secretary for near eastern affairs robert pelletreau in september " to solidify the cease-fire and to pursue reconciliation " , davies said .
his statement gave no venue or precise date for the meeting .
the united states has already called on the kurdish factions to hold peace talks in london .
the kdp said thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of puk fighters , killing , wounding or capturing about 400 opposing guerrillas .
the fighting has threatened a u.s.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous kurdish region in northern iraq against president saddam hussein .
one teen left dead by attack on u.s. slumber party .
chesapeake , va .
1996-08-23
a knife-wielding neighbour apparently intent on sexual assault invaded a teenage slumber party on friday , killing one girl and wounding three others , police said .
at about 4 a.m. edt ( 0800 gmt ) , a group of teenaged girls were having the overnight party in the camelot subdivision of this eastern virginia city , when a man entered the house , wielding a knife , threatening to sexually assault the girls .
detective richard black of the chesapeake police department , said a neighbour , curtis lee white ii , 19 , was arrested in the attack , but had not been charged by late morning on friday .
there were apparently no adults at the party as the father of the family who lived in the house was out of town and the mother died more than a year ago , black said .
the detective said details were sketchy , but two of the teenagers were reportedly downstairs watching television when white allegedly entered the house and told the girls to take off their clothes .
he said a male teenager sleeping upstairs reportedly heard the commotion and came downstairs and confronted white , who allegedly stabbed him more than once .
the other teenagers also confronted the assailant and three girls , all under 18 , were stabbed , one fatally .
" at least two of them were sexually molested , " black said .
he said all of the wounded teenagers were taken to a hospital but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening .
police said the girl who died was identified as michelle harper .
her age was not given .

washington to curb tamil support in u.s. - sri lanka .
colombo 1996-08-23
sri lanka said on friday the united states had promised to stamp out any illegal activities on u.s. soil directed against the island 's government .
the sri lankan foreign ministry said in a statement : " the united states government sympathised with the current predicament sri lanka was facing . "
the statement said the u.s. government " would do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of american soil to perpetrate violence against the democratic government of sri lanka " .
it said the u.s. state department 's coordinator for counter terrorism , philip wilcox , had expressed washington 's support for the government when he visited colombo this week .
colombo has said it believes tamil rebels , fighting a 13-year war for independence against the government , finance their military activity through funds extorted from expatriate sri lankans in western countries such as the united states .
u.s. embassy officials in colombo were not immediately available to comment on the report .
colombo estimates more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war between government forces and the liberation tigers of tamil eelam rebels in the island 's north and east .
nepal 's king leaves on week-long visit to china .
kathmandu 1996-08-23
king birendra left nepal on friday for a week-long visit to china , his eighth since ascending the throne in 1972 , officials said .
the constitutional monarch , who last visited china in 1993 , was scheduled to meet chinese president jiang zemin and premier li peng during his visit , they said .
foreign ministry officials gave no details of the issues the king , who was accompanied by foreign minister prakash chandra lohani , would discuss with chinese leaders .
the himalayan kingdom , sandwiched between china and india , has traditionally sought to maintain close cooperation with its giant neighbours , and an equal distance from the two .
the 50-year old monarch was accompanied by queen aishwarya on a flight to the tibetan capital of lhasa .
the king will visit chongqing before arriving in the chinese capital , beijing , early next week , officials said .
nepal man held for keeping child servant in chains .
kathmandu 1996-08-23
nepali police said on friday they arrested a man who allegedly kept a child servant bound in chains so that he would not run away when his employer was out to work .
madhusudan munakarmi was arrested on thursday after his neighbours informed police about the plight of 12-year old dhiraj k.c. , who told police his employer used to tie him up with iron chains and locks concealed under his clothes .
the neighbours in kathmandu called the police when they saw dheeraj , employed by the man for the past nine months , limping because of the chains .
" i feared he would flee from work or steal my belongings , " the kathmandu post newspaper quoted munakarmi as saying after his arrest .
if convicted , he faces a maximum of three years in jail under nepal 's child protection laws .
options - euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall .
london 1996-08-23
implied volatility of european bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's german-led cut in interest rates , traders said .
" volatility has come off a lot .
we 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one euromark options trader at a u.s. bank .
a trader at a japanese bank said euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for september contract , 16.75 for december , 19.50 for march and 21.25 for june .
this compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for september , 20.00 for december , 22.00 for march and 23.5 for june , he said .
at 1347 gmt , december euromark futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day .
he said the sell-off in june vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels .
he said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end .
the size of the bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise .
" volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said .
" long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high .
" it is not a dangerous level to own vol. you are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . "
he said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in britain .
paribas capital markets otc options specialist robert coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of friday in over-the-counter 10-year bunds , it should be higher next tuesday .
he said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as italy , spain and sweden .
coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size .
" i recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in germany and france in particular .
" with high-yielding markets italy will be a lot more vulnerable in september on economic and political fronts , so i would use current the low level of vol to buy options .
" so sell options on bunds and france to enhance yield and buy options on italy , " coughlan said ..

legal challenge to diana delayed by jail term .
london 1996-08-23
a british photographer branded a stalker by princess diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage , his lawyer said on friday .
martin stenning started a 12-week jail sentence on thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by diana banning him from coming within 300 metres ( yards ) of her .
" we were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks , " said stenning 's lawyer , benedict birnberg . "
but everything has been put on ice now . "
birnberg told reuters that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until stenning was released .
stenning threw a brick through the window of a van in february after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider .
stenning , who has previous convictions , is expected to appeal against the sentence .
magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 182 pounds ( $ 282 ) .
the freelance photographer was branded a stalker by diana , whose divorce from heir-to-the-throne prince charles is due to become final next week , after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle .
in an affidavit , the princess said that in chasing her stenning had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera .
stenning has rejected diana 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers .
jordan expels iraqi diplomat .
amman 1996-08-23
jordan has asked an iraqi diplomat to leave the kingdom for carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , an official source said on friday .
the move came after amman blamed iraq and a pro-baghdad local political party for last week 's worst unrest in seven years after a government decision to double prices of bread .
the government declined comment .
" jordan has asked mr. adel ibrahim , the iraqi embassy 's press attache , to leave because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , " the source told reuters .
he said ibrahim was still in amman .
the jordanian arab socialist baath party has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .
the riots , which shook jordan for two days , broke out after last friday 's main prayers in the southern town of karak and spread to amman .
kurd rebels to free turkish soldier prisoners .
dohuk , iraq 1996-08-23
turkish kurd guerrillas said on friday they would free seven turkish soldiers they hold in northern iraq under a tentative islamist peace bid .
" ...for the sake of safety we are asking for their family members or the authorities to come and pick them up , " kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) central committee member riza altun told journalists near the iraqi city of dohuk .
pkk guerrillas would accompany the soldiers , captured last spring in one of turkey 's frequent cross-border drives , until they could be handed over , he said .
their release has been negotiated by islamist writer ismail nacar as part of a wider effort , partly backed by prime minister necmettin erbakan , to find a political solution to turkey 's kurdish problem .
erbakan has encouraged nacar 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels .
the pkk often uses bases in northern iraq in its fight for autonomy or independence in southeast turkey .
more than 20,000 people have died in 12 years of fighting between the guerrillas and turkish forces .

zenith lands $ 1 billion contract , plans $ 100 million plant .
susan nadeau
chicago 1996-08-22
a consortium of telephone companies and the walt disney co .
said thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service .
the announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to zenith , which has struggled with years of losses .
" this really indicates we 're back in the business , " william luehrs , president of the glenview , ill.-based company 's networks services division , said in a telephone interview . "
anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "
following the announcement , zenith 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the new york stock exchange .
the consortium , called americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment .
in addition to disney , americast 's partners are phone companies ameritech corp. , bellsouth corp. , gte corp. and sbc communications .
americast said southern new england telecommunications corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television .
zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in woodridge , ill .
, to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen tv sets .
the company currently buys the tubes from competitors .
the new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , zenith said .
the contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years .
luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year .
the boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis .
zenith will convert its chihuahua , mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes .
luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable .
americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service .
its service is being introduced in selected markets across the united states .
luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics .
" we 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . "
although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . "
zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 .
last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .
last november , south korea-based lg electronics inc. bought a majority stake in zenith .
robert gutenstein , an analyst for kalf , voorhis & co .
, said the contract was " not unique , but it 's big . "
" digital is coming , it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . "
natural law party says it can meditate problems away .
washington 1996-08-22
from the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes the natural law party , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on thursday .
at a hotel convention here , the party associated with the transcendental meditation ( tm ) movement named physicist john hagelin as its presidential nominee for the nov. 5 election .
the party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars .
" social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper .
many party members are practitioners of tm , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra .
some advanced tm followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly .
but in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position .
huge windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations .
martin wolk
seattle 1996-08-22
a year after its massively publicized introduction , microsoft corp. 's windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .
even though more than 40 million copies of windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .
the redmond , wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the times of london and lighting new york 's empire state building in a windows color scheme .
but the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .
" it did n't do as well as it could have , " said rob enderle , an analyst with giga information group .
scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .
" people who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said scott winkler , an analyst with gartner group .
" it 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . "
it just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "
symantec corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .
touchstone software corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the windows 95 launch .
many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said ann stephens , president of pc data inc .
to be sure , sales of windows 95 and the accompanying office 95 upgrade drove microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company .
microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .
but enderle said the figure could have been even higher if microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .
he and other analysts said corporate america adopted a go-slow approach because microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end windows nt operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .
" microsoft sent a lot of signals that nt was going to be the answer , " winkler said . "
many people began to believe that windows 95 was being downplayed . "
but now that windows nt 4.0 has been launched , winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of windows 95 .
" windows 95 is going to do great , " he said . "
the mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . "
u.s. says still committed to cuba migration pacts .
washington 1996-08-22
the united states said on thursday it remained committed to migration accords with cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted cuban migrants who attempted to enter u.s. territory illegally .
a state department statement appeared in part a response to cuban complaints that washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents .
" the united states reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 , said the statement by spokesman glyn davies .
" the united states will continue to return cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the united states or the guantanamo naval base illegally , " it said .
washington would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from cuba , it added .
davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the cuban exile community in miami " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from cuba to florida .
havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the florida straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from cuba .
sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to cuba but eight were taken to the united states and three to guantanamo bay , a u.s. base on cuba , until they emigrated to another nation .
the most recent hijacking , last friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft .
davies said on tuesday the pilot could soon return to cuba but u.s. authorities planned to try the hijackers .
in an incident on july 7 , a cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at guantanamo bay .
davies said he knew of no plans to return the man to cuba .
wis .
says is first state to apply for new welfare .
chicago 1996-08-22
in keeping with its pioneering image in the area of welfare , wisconsin was the first state to submit an administrative plan under the nation 's new welfare law , gov .
tommy thompson said thursday .
according to a new release from the governor , wisconsin submitted a plan to the u.s. department of health and human services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after president bill clinton signed the measure into law thursday .
" as the nation 's leader in welfare reform , wisconsin is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system , " thompson said .
still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program , dubbed w-2 .
he said that despite the new law , wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents .
the nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility , gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children .

snoozing vietnamese man takes slow train to alaska .
anchorage , alaska 1996-08-22
a vietnamese man who tried to take a snooze in a railway boxcar in canada found himself locked in and bound for alaska with no food or water .
officials in the port of whittier said on thursday that they found tuan quac phan , 29 , dehydrated , famished and terrified after sailing to alaska from canada in the boxcar loaded on a barge , a trip that takes about five days .

" he had climbed up in this boxcar to get out of the weather and to get some sleep , " jewell said . "
the next thing you know , the boxcar is coupled up and loaded up to a barge and headed north . "
police found phan late on monday when the boxcar , which was transporting lumber , was opened at whittier , a port in western prince william sound .

1996-08-22
state and federal agents on thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black arkansas churches that burned within minutes of one another late tuesday and early wednesday .
both churches were in the mississippi delta region of arkansas , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of little rock , and were located within three miles of one another .
" we 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that has n't been conclusively established , " said wayne jordan , a spokesman for the arkansas state police .
agents of the f.b.i. and the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms were also at the scene , jordan said .
mount zion missionary baptist church and st. matthews missionary baptist church were both frame structures , each near turner , arkansas , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields .
" this is rural arkansas .
i 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said fannie johnson , a member of st. matthew 's , who said she believed arson was to blame .
others connected with the two churches said they shared that suspicion , although all said they knew of no motive and no racial tension in the area .
" it 's sad someone would have that kind of spite in their heart , " said rev. jerome turner , pastor of mount zion missionary baptist church .
arkansas has been spared the loss of predominantly black churches to arson , a wave that has claimed an estimated 30 houses of worship across the south in the past several months .
a black church near camden , arkansas , about 100 miles ( 161 kms ) south of little rock , burned in july , but federal agents have not determined the cause .

amsterdam 1996-08-23
dutch post and telecoms group koninklijke ptt nederland nv 's ( dutch ptt ) first half results came marginally below most analysts ' forecasts , giving scant grounds to adjust full year estimates , analysts said on friday .
ptt earlier announced an 8.5 percent rise in net profit for the first six months of 1996 to 1.209 billion guilders , a hair 's breadth below the 1.210-1.236 billion forecast range .
" they were pretty much in line with our estimate of 1.210 billion , " said peter roe , at paribas in london . "
as we expected volume growth was quite good ...
there 's really no reason to change our forecast and our largely positive view on the stock . "
" coming just a million guilders under the forecast range is n't overwhelmingly surprising , " said ing analyst steven vrolijk , who is continuing to look for a nine to 10 percent rise in 1996 earnings .
" they 've got a very sound domestic business which is doing very well , we remain positive on the stock , " said roe . "
we think it 's a solid performer in the dutch market . "
roe said he was sticking by his forecast of a 2.45 billion guilder net for 1996 .
dutch ptt earlier on friday repeated a forecast it would improve on 1995 's 2.26 billion guilder net profit for the whole year of 1996 .

sea lion paparazzi to keep tabs on whales .
london 1996-08-22
u.s. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the pacific depths , new scientist magazine reported on thursday .
james harvey and jennifer hurley of the moss landing marine laboratories in california say their sea lions , natural companions of many species of whale , can go where no man or woman has ever gone before .
" any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up , " harvey told the magazine . "
that is why we know only about five percent of what whales do . "
the sea lions -- 17-year-old beaver and nine-year-old sake -- have undergone six years of training for their mission .
beaver once worked for the u.s. navy and sake is an amusement park veteran .
harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter , and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals , filming it with a video camera .
their first assignment , later this year , will be documenting humpback whale migration off monterey , california .
the article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups .
rtrs - australia senate jeopardises rate cut - howard .
canberra 1996-08-23
australian prime minister john howard said the possibility of lower interest rates was being jeopardised by parliament 's upper house where opposition parties planned to scrutinise the 1996/97 budget .
" every time the senate hacks away at the budget , they hack away at the lower interest rate environment , " howard told reporters on thursday night after attending a liberal party function .
senior ministers have repeatedly warned since the fiscally-tight budget was handed down on tuesday night that the chance of lower official rates could be hampered in the senate .
the budget contained sharp spending cuts in areas such as the labour market to reduce the deficit to about a$ 5.6 billion .
the conservative government 's plan for reform of the industrial relations environment and to partially sell telstra has also been opposed by parties in the senate such as the greens and australian democrats as well as the official opposition , the labor party .
official cash rates were last cut on july 31 to 7.0 percent .

china copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade .
lynne o'donnell
hong kong 1996-08-23
up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to china 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on friday .
around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .
just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into shanghai by the china national nonferrous metals import and export corp ( cniec ) in june and july .
it was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's state planning commission , owned the copper .
traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .
but one source , the head of a hong kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .
" if they spend all this money moving the copper to yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .
" once it arrives in yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the state planning commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .
mystery has surrounded the shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .
trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the london metal exchange ( lme ) .
a backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .
cniec lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the lme between april and june 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .
traders in asia said cniec could well have lent it to the market at around us$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .
this would have cleared cniec a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .
word that cniec had offered the copper to european trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .
industry analysts bloomsbury minerals economics ( bme ) said on wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .
bme repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by sumitomo corp , with cniec said to be helping the japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in june losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .
sumitomo and cniec have made no comments on the talk and chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .
traders in shanghai said on thursday they were unaware of movements out of the shanghai bonded warehouses .
they reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .
they also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .
but these concerns were irrelevant , a singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .
as with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . "
you do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . "

cricket - essex poised to step up title challenge .
london 1996-08-24
essex are set to step up their english county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair neil williams and mark ilott sent gloucestershire reeling on saturday .
williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer ilott also captured two as gloucestershire , 252 behind on first innings , slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at colchester .
essex , who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders derbyshire with a game in hand , could go top if they complete victory on monday 's last day and other results favour them .
williams thrust essex on course for success by dispatching matt windows and andrew symonds in his second over , before ilott removed dominic hewson and tim hancock to reduce gloucestershire to 17 for four at one stage .
the visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former england captain graham gooch when he added just six to his overnight 105 , but essex went on to make 532 for eight before declaring .
captain paul prichard plundered 88 from 73 deliveries , hitting 15 fours and one six .
second-placed kent were frustrated by rain which prevented any play at cardiff , where they have reached 255 for three in their first innings against glamorgan , while third-placed surrey are facing an uphill task against nottinghamshire .
surrey slipped to 88 for four in reply to notts ' commanding first innings of 446 for nine declared at trent bridge , before alistair brown struck a 55-ball half-century .
brown 's 56 not out , containing eight fours and three sixes , lifted surrey to 128 for four on a rain-curtailed day .
fourth-placed leicestershire had hampshire on the ropes at leicester before rain intervened .
pace trio david millns ( 2-24 ) , gordon parsons ( 3-20 ) and vince wells ( 2-19 ) had hampshire reeling at 81 for seven in reply to the home county 's first innings of 353 .
yorkshire rekindled their title hopes after three successive defeats by taking the upper hand against arch-rivals lancashire at old trafford .
facing yorkshire 's 529 for eight declared , lancashire were forced to follow on 206 behind after being bowled out for 323 , paceman darren gough polishing off the innings with a burst of three wickets for one run in 17 deliveries .
lancashire then reached 210 for five at the close -- just four ahead -- after neil fairbrother hit 55 in 60 balls to add to his first innings of 86 .

soccer - out-of-sorts newcastle crash 2-1 at home .
london 1996-08-24
newcastle 's early season teething problems continued on saturday when they lost 2-1 at home to premier league pacesetters sheffield wednesday .
england striker alan shearer gave kevin keegan 's talent-laden side the lead from the penalty spot after 13 minutes after wednesday 's yugoslav dejan stefanovic pulled down colombian forward faustino asprilla .
but two minutes later wednesday equalised through peter atherton , who found space in the penalty area to meet mark pembridge 's free kick with a precise glancing header .
guy whittingham stole three points for the yorkshire side with a goal 10 minutes from time .
to add to newcastle 's misery , england striker les ferdinand was stretchered off in the second half .
wednesday , who escaped relegation on the final day of last season , have now won their first three games of the season .
elsewhere , title hopefuls liverpool were held 0-0 at home by newly-promoted sunderland , and in london , the tie between tottenham hotspur and everton also ended goaless .
frenchman frank leboeuf and italian gianluca vialli scored their first premier league goals as chelsea beat coventry 2-0 , and managerless arsenal won by the same scoreline at leicester .

rugby union - new zealand win first series in south africa .
pretoria , south africa 1996-08-24
new zealand made history on saturday when they completed their first series victory in south africa with a 33-26 victory in the second test .
the win gave the all blacks an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-test series .
each side scored three tries and the springboks outscored the all blacks 15-12 in the second half but still suffered a fourth successive defeat against their old enemies .
two tries from wing jeff wilson in the first quarter gave new zealand a 24-11 lead before tries from flanker ruben kruger and scrum-half joost van der westhuizen in the space of two minutes narrowed the gap to a single point at 23-24 .
the springboks would have gone ahead had not fly-half joel stransky 's conversion hit an upright and new zealand only scrambled to safety through a fine penalty from replacement fly-half jon preston and a drop goal by number eight zinzan brooke .

soccer - disappointing ajax slump 2-0 at heerenveen .
amsterdam 1996-08-24
dutch champions ajax amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on saturday losing 2-0 away at heerenveen .
ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating nac of breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .
eight minutes after the interval , heerenveen 's romeo wouden broke through the amsterdam defence , left defender john veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper edwin van der sar into the ajax net .
ajax , without injured defenders marcio santos and winston bogarde and strikers jari litmanen and marc overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .
but they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes danish striker jon dahl tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the ajax defence and lobbed van der sar .
the defeat means ajax 's main title contenders psv eindhoven , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat groningen on sunday .

" the worst period of physical manhandling was during that time when we were beaten with kalashnikovs and at one point i had a kalashnikov held to the back of my throat -- cocked , " he said .
" for the first period we were held in a small room with no bed or anything .
we had very little food and sometimes went two or three days without eating . "
gunmen seized penrose , who comes from swerford in southern england , frenchman frederic malardeau and six other hostages from their car in grozny , the capital of chechnya , on july 27 .
the assailants had demanded a ransom of 300,000 pounds ( $ 465,000 ) but no money was paid by the charity when they were released on wednesday .
the hostages were held in a house in or near grozny which was bombarded regularly .
" during the last 15 days of being held , the fighting in grozny was very close .
at first it was street fighting outside the house and then we came under very heavy shelling and bombardment from conventional weapons like tanks , artillery and grenade launchers , " he said .
penrose had been working for the charity which provides food to civilians for only a few weeks before he was captured .
when asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting russian troops for full independence , penrose said : " not for the time being .
i do n't think it 's safe for me .
but maybe in the future , depending on the circumstances . "

zimbabwe fires striking civil servants .
emelia sithole
harare 1996-08-24
the zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights .
the public service commission ( psc ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on monday .
" all civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on 23 august 1996 , have been summarily dismissed ...
with immediate effect , " it said in a statement .
union officials from the public service association ( psa ) were unavailable for comment .
public service , labour and social welfare minister florence chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms .
the government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on tuesday , saying it was illegal .
but the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met .
the stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the red cross .
it has also disrupted flights .
some internal services were cancelled , leaving tourists at the victoria falls resort stranded , and flights abroad were delayed .
the psa said 80 percent of the country 's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to president robert mugabe , who has been in power since independence from britain in 1980 .
opposition parties , civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government 's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers .
civil servants earn on average z$ 1,000 ( $ 100 ) a month .
they say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation , currently running at 22 percent .
rwanda says zaire expels 28 rwandan refugees .
kigali 1996-08-24
rwanda said on saturday that zaire had expelled 28 rwandan hutu refugees accused of being " trouble-makers " in camps in eastern zaire .
captain firmin gatera , spokesman for the tutsi-dominated rwandan army , told reuters in kigali that 17 of the 28 refugees handed over on friday from the zairean town of goma had been soldiers in the former hutu army which fled to zaire in 1994 after being defeated by tutsi forces in rwanda 's civil war .
zairean prime minister kengo wa dondo said on thursday in a visit to rwanda that his country would expell all the refugees back to rwanda but he gave no timeframe .
zaire is home to 1.1 million rwandan hutu refugees who fled three months of civil war in 1994 .
many had taken part in the genocide that year of one million people , mostly tutsis , and refuse to go home for fear of reprisal at the hands of the new tutsi-dominated government in kigali .
gatera said the refugees were handed over following a deal made at a meeting between the governor of zaire 's north kivu region and his counterpart in the rwandan border town of gisenyi .
" after a meeting between the governor of north kivu and the prefect of gisenyi , 28 prisoners ( refugees ) were handed over to rwandan authorities on friday , " gatera said . "
out of these 17 were former soldiers .
these people are now in gisenyi prison , " gatera added .
revered skull of s. africa king is scottish woman 's .
johannesburg 1996-08-24
a limelight-loving south african chief was in disgrace on saturday after a prized skull he brought home from scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman .
a forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century king hintsa , a chief of president nelson mandela 's xhosa tribe killed in battle by the british , said it was in fact the cranium of a european woman .
chief nicholas gcaleka , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry scotland in february on a hugely publicised quest to find hintsa 's skull .
the witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head , said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded hintsa after a battle in 1835 .
but gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to south africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely highland forest near inverness .
he said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there .
members of the xhosa royal family , branding gcaleka a charlatan , confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist , who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come , as supposed , from a bullet .
" it can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king , " the scientist said in a statement .
sudan arrests opposition sewing machine smugglers .
khartoum 1996-08-24
sudanese police have arrested three people trying to smuggle sewing machines and army clothing to sudanese opposition groups in eritrea , an official newspaper reported on saturday .
the government-owned al-ingaz al-watani said the smugglers were caught in banat in the eastern state of kassala , on the border with eritrea , and had confessed they were on their way to " the so-called alliance forces which have been undertaking subversive operations on the eastern border " .
authorities in kassala said opposition forces based in eritrea have been laying landmines and stealing vehicles and other goods to smuggle them across the border into eritrea .
sudan accuses the eritrean authorities of providing support to sudanese opposition elements based in eritrea .
eritrea cut diplomatic ties with sudan in 1994 , accusing it of training rebels to make raids into eritrea .
the exiled national democratic alliance , a sudanese umbrella opposition group , has its headquarters in the eritrean capital asmara .
it uses the former sudanese embassy .
albanian socialists start landmark reform congress .
tirana 1996-08-24
albania 's opposition socialist party began a two-day congress on saturday to discuss major jettisoning its links with almost half a century of stalinist dictatorship in the balkan country .
" the congress will approve new concepts that will turn the party into a social-democratic and electoral party , not a class and ideological one , " the socialist zeri i popullit daily said in an editorial .
jailed socialist leader fatos nano made the first call for change in july , a month after the party 's chief opponents , the conservative democrats of president sali berisha , almost swept the board in a disputed general election .
the socialists , reformed heirs to the communists , pulled out of the poll saying it was a sham .
acting socialist leader servet pellumbi has said he too will urge the party to scrap the ideas of karl marx at the congress .
the pro-reform stance of some of the party leadership initially caused a storm and triggered the resignation last month of the party 's secretary-general gramoz ruci .
more recently political commentators have reported a growing consensus , however , and a rift at the meeting looks increasingly unlikely .

main tunisian opposition party ousted from hq .
tunis 1996-08-24
tunisia 's main opposition party on saturday announced that it had been ousted from its headquarters building by a court decision for failing to pay the rent .
mohamed ali khalfallah , spokesman for the movement of socialist democrats ( mds ) said that a bailiff who was accompagnied by policemen , on saturday ordered the party to leave the building .
" we were not allowed a delay to enable us to transfer the movement 's goods and documents , " khalfallah added in a statement .
the building is state property .
the mds was represented in court and admitted owing money for rent but did not give details .
mds this year lost its president and vice-president , both of whom were tried and given jail sentences .
mds president mohamed moada was sentenced last february to 11 years in jail on charges of having secret contacts with libyan agents and receiving money from tripoli .
vice-president khemais chammari last july was sentenced to five years in prison on a charge of disclosing secrets of judicial proceedings in moada 's affair .
to replace moada , the mds after the trial named khalfallah as " coordinator " but ismail boulahya , the last of the mds founding members still politically active , claimed the title of president , causing a new split within the movement .

kurdish group says two killed in iraqi shelling .
nicosia 1996-08-24
an iraqi kurdish guerrilla group on saturday accused iraqi government forces of killing two civilians in shelling in northern iraq , the iranian news agency irna reported .
irna said it was monitoring a report from a radio station affiliated to the patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) .
" iraqi army heavily shelled the kanie karzhala camp , west of arbil , on friday ...
two civilians were killed in the iraqi bombing , " irna quoted the radio report as saying .
the puk-run radio on friday said iraqi heavy artillery was pounding its positions in kurdish-controlled northern iraq but it gave no details of casualties .
there was no independent confirmation of the reports .
the rival kurdistan democratic party ( kdp ) , which accuses iran of supporting the puk , said on thursday that its forces had halted an iranian-backed attack by thousands of puk fighters .
the united states said in washington on friday that it had brokered a ceasefire to end six days of fighting between the two main kurdish factions and persuaded them to attend u.s.-mediated peace talks next month .
the clashes , shattering a ceasefire negotiated last year by washington , had threatened a u.s.-led peace plan to unite the kurdish region against iraqi president saddam hussein .
u.s. , british and french planes have been patrolling the skies of northern iraq since shortly after the 1991 gulf war to shield iraq 's kurds from any attack by iraqi troops .

clinton campaign busy making " news " .
laurence mcquillan
washington 1996-08-24
president bill clinton has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year .
with democrats gathering in chicago to start a convention on monday to nominate him for a second term as president , clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded republican conclave that gave a boost to rival bob dole .
after a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the republican-controlled congress , clinton used his saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime .
" sixty days ago i directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " clinton said . "
that plan has now reached my desk . "
" today i am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said .
actually , creation of such a registry was underway without clinton lifting a finger .
attorney general janet reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the fbi until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established .
two months ago , clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established .
now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again .
it is an example of clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the nov. 5 presidential election .
such things do not happen by chance in the clinton white house , they are part of his political chess game .
in the past week clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system .
" america can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " clinton said , without even a passing reference to the republican majority in the house and senate .
" america is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week .
according to a senior campaign official , clinton " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . "
clinton departs on sunday on a four-day train trip through west virginia , kentucky , ohio , michigan and indiana while fellow democrats are gathered in chicago .
" he 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . "
we think it 'll work really well . "
although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention .
each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .
campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme .
" we 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said white house press secretary mike mccurry .
mccurry said that when clinton delivers his acceptance address on thursday night to fellow democrats and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the white house for four more years .
hurricane expected to veer north of caribbean .
miami 1996-08-24
hurricane edouard grew stronger on saturday as it swirled across the atlantic ocean , but forecasters at the national hurricane center said the storm would likely swing north and miss the caribbean .
" edouard is getting stronger and stronger , and it already has winds of 105 mph ( 185 kph ) , " said hurricane forecaster lixion avila .
" but the good news is that all our computer models indicate edouard is going to turn to the west-northwest on sunday and miss the islands , " he added .
at 11 a.m. edt ( 1500 gmt ) , edouard was 1,130 miles east of the lesser antilles and moving west at 14 mph ( 25 kph ) .
its exact position was latitude 14.5 north , longitude 44.2 west .
france hands suspected eta member to spain .
paris 1996-08-24
france on saturday handed a suspected member of the basque separatist group eta to spanish authorities , french interior ministry officials said .
ignacio olascoaga mugica , who had just ended a prison sentence in france , is suspected of having taken part in several guerrilla attacks in spain .

german troops to remain in bosnia for 1997--ruehe .
bonn 1996-08-24
defence minister volker ruehe said that german troops would stay on in bosnia next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on saturday .
the current nato-led peace force ( ifor ) in bosnia is due to return home at the end of the year .
but ruehe told bild am sonntag in an interview that a " new and different mandate " for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in december .
" after the ( bosnian ) elections ( on september 14 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of october from 60,000 to about 20,000 .
a completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , " ruehe said .
" the defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of september at a nato meeting , " he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on sunday .
" but we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former yugoslavia is being perceived in the long run as an occupation .
on the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres " he said .
italian comics hope independence-joke 's on bossi .
orvieto , italy 1996-08-24
a group of italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader umberto bossi next month when they lead the ancient etruscan town of orvieto in a mock split from rome .
orvieto mayor stefano cimicchi said the comics , including popular actor roberto benigni , would declare orvieto " capital of etruria " on september 15 -- the day bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from rome .
" we will then proceed with the annexation of sardinia , corsica and cyprus , " cimicchi told reporters on saturday .
he said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day bossi has threatened to declare the birth of padania , the name he has given to northern italy .
orvieto , located in umbria between rome and florence , was once the capital of etruria , an ancient federation of 12 etruscan towns .
" we want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around september 15 , " cimicchi said .
" we want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added .
bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his northern league party 's good showing in last april 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally .
he has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .
italian farmer says he mutilated four women .
verona , italy 1996-08-24
an italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the italian news agency ansa reported on saturday .
it quoted the lawyer of gianfranco stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on friday to a verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women .
ansa said stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having sadmasochistic sex with them .
stevanin , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside verona between july and december 1995 .
two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal .
lawyer cesare dal maso told ansa that stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby adige river .
dal maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that " the interrogations are not over yet " with investigators .
it said investigators believed stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads .
stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by .
belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police .
jeremy lovell
brussels 1996-08-24
belgian police searched two more houses on saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout europe .
recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist marc dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long .
in just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others .
on saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at ransart and one at mont-sur-marchienne -- both suburbs of the southern city of charleroi .
both houses are owned by dutroux .
belgian media speculated that dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters .
they put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor michel bourlet on belgian television on friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if i am allowed to " .
bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured dutroux .
dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around charleroi .
just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses .
julie lejeune and melissa russo , had been kidnapped in june last year .
dutroux said they starved to death nine months later .
he also admitted kidnapping two other girls , an marchal and eefje lambrecks , a year ago .
the fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in slovakia or the czech republic where dutroux was a frequent visitor .
belgian police have visited bratislava and will visit prague .
five other people have been arrested including dutroux 's second wife michelle martin , charged as an accomplice .
the others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association .
dutch police are also holding a 74-year old dutchman in connection with the disappearance of an and eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established .
at least part of the speculation in the belgian media of high-level protection for dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference .
among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " othello " against dutroux in 1995 -- when both julie and melissa and an and eefje were kidnapped .
they show that the gendarmes were aware that dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was .
they also show that police investigating a theft visited dutroux late last year at the house where julie and melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours .
justice minister stefaan de clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up .
there is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .
death toll of algeria bomb put at seven-newspaper .
paris 1996-08-24
an algerian newspaper on saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of algiers on friday .
algerian security forces said on friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of bou haroun , 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of algiers .
the security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely .
el-watan paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 25-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl .
several people were also wounded , it said .
the explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in algeria 's four-year-old civil strife .
the government-appointed watchdog , human rights national observatory , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on moslem rebels in the past two years .
an estimated 50,000 algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical islamists had taken a commanding lead .

most spaniards back talks with basque rebels--poll .
madrid 1996-08-24
most spaniards would support government talks with the illegal basque separatist group eta if the rebels renounced violence permanently , a survey published in daily el mundo on saturday said .
while 57 percent of the population supported negotiations with eta ( basque homeland and freedom ) , 30 percent opposed it , the survey by the state-controlled centre for sociological studies ( cis ) found .
but 80 percent said eta had shown little interest in achieving peace in the basque country when it offered a one-week truce in july while continuing to hold prison officer jose antonio ortega lara , kidnapped in january .
the problem of terrorism had neither worsened nor improved since the conservative popular party ( pp ) came to power in may , according to 56 percent of those questioned , while 22 percent said it had worsened .
the survey questioned 2,496 people between july 17 and 21 and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percent .
thirty killed as floods plunge lahore into chaos .
islamabad 1996-08-24
at least 30 people have been killed and about 100 injured in the flood-hit pakistani city of lahore , newspapers reported on saturday .
they said 461 mm ( 18 inches ) of rain had drenched the punjab provincial capital in 36 hours , turning streets into rivers , knocking out power , water and telephone services , disrupting air and rail traffic , and sweeping away houses and cars .
newspapers quoted witnesses as saying they had seen bodies floating in the streets .
among the dead were five members of the religious jamaat-i-islami party who drowned while trying to remove books from a basement library .
they said thousands of people had been made homeless after a breach opened in the city canal , inundating residential areas .
army troops were called in to evacuate residents of low-lying areas to higher ground .
officials said the ravi and chenab rivers , which both flow through punjab , were in high flood and emergency services backed by troops were on full alert .
internet startup funded to develop java software .
mountain view , calif. 1996-08-25
a small team of engineers from sun microsystems inc. 's javasoft unit said sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed internet startup , to build java infrastructure software .
the fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from bessemer venture partners of menlo park , calif ..
david cowan , internet startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of bessemer .
the startup company 's acting chairman is jim bidzos , the president of rsa data security , a unit of security dynamics technologies inc. as well as chairman of verisign .
internet startup , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at javasoft , apple computer inc. , and oracle systems .
" java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the internet , " said hong bui , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at javasoft .
java is a computer programming language introduced by sun microsystems in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner .
just last week , sun microsystems and the silicon valley venture capital giant kleiner perkins caufield & byers said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by kleiner perkins to fund startups developing java technologies .
java has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations , ranging from microsoft corp. and international business machines corp. to the taiwan government .
prasad wagle , another former senior javasoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at internet startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using java to make networked applications ubiquitious .
one feature of the java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use .
in this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .
chris zuleeg , a veteran of apple and a former javasoft marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at internet startup , whose web site is www.internetstartup.com .
bessemer has funded numerous internet pioneers , including psi net , verisign and individual .
golf - mickelson wins fourth title of year in akron .
akron , ohio 1996-08-25
phil mickelson birdied two of the last three holes to win world series of golf by three strokes over billy mayfair on sunday .
it was the fourth tournament title this year for mickelson , who shot an even-par 70 , after being tied for the lead with billy mayfair with three holes to play .
along with mayfiar at 277 for the tournament were steve stricker , who had a 68 , and duffy waldorf , with a 66 .
" it was very hard to sleep last night because there was so much i could accomplish with this win , " said mickelson , who had a three-stroke lead entering the third round . "
this was a win i wanted very , very much . "
mickelson 's victory gave him a 10 year exemption to the pga tour .
the $ 378,000 first place check brings mickelson back to the top of the money list with $ 1,574,799 won this year .
" this is a major championship golf course , and for me to perform well on this style of course is a big step up for me in my career and my performance in future majors , " he said .
mickelson three-stroke lead was cut to two when mayfair birdied the course 's only easy hole , the par five second hole , while mickelson three-putted for par from 25 feet .
on the back nine mickelson began driving erratically , and poor tee shots resulted in bogeys on the , eighth , 12th and 13th holes , bringing mickelson back to four under par , tied with mayfair , who had parred 14 straight holes after the birdie on no.2 .
mickelson then set up a tap in birdie on the 16th , sending a wedge shot to 18 inches .
he had another birdie on the 17th , where he his a 6-iron to six feet .
mayfair bogeyed the 17th , missing a five foot par putt , and dropped from solo second place to a three way tie for second .
it was the second successive year in which mayfair has finished runner up in this tournament .
he lost to greg norman in sudden death last year .
the defending champion was in contention , two behind mickelson for much of the day , until he bogeyed the 13th and 14th holes .

motorcycling - japanese win both round nine superbike races .
sugo , japan 1996-08-25
teenager yuuichi takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on sunday .
takeda , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake australian ducati rider troy corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left .
honda 's takeda was pursued past corser by the yamaha duo of noriyuki haga and wataru yoshikawa with haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap .
but takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with haga second and yoshikawa third .
haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph .
corser , who crashed during practice on friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind takeda with championship leader aaron slight of new zealand 11 seconds behind the winner .
in the second race , takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner takuma aoki .
aoki , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion haruchika , had a race-long duel with john kocinski of the united states on a ducati before taking the chequered flag .
kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by takeda .
with takeda out of the race , kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake aoki .
haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of slight with corser in 10th place .
but the strong showing by the japanese riders did not alter the championship table with slight still leading on 280 points , followed by corser with 269 and kocinski with 254 .

cricket - pollock concludes warwickshire career with flourish .
london 1996-08-25
south african fast bowler shaun pollock concluded his warwickshire career with a flourish on sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's sunday league victory over worcestershire .
pollock , who returns home on tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as worcestershire were dismissed for 154 .
after an hour 's interruption for rain , warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games .
warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind yorkshire , nottinghamshire and surrey .
yorkshire captain david byas completed his third sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against lancashire .
lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before byas put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours .
yorkshire eventually reached their target with only four wickets down and 7.5 overs to spare .

cricket - run-out gives lewis and england slim satisfaction .
london 1996-08-25
chris lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the england one-day squad on sunday but could not prevent pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at the oval .
a super piece of fielding by lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for england as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 .
the solitary wicket to fall was asif mujtaba , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where lewis was lurking with a point to prove .
there seemed scant danger until the surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate alec stewart who whipped off the bails .
lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as salim malik and wasim akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .
wasim rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .
rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again .
the weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 1445 local time ( 1345 gmt ) .

baltimore 1996-08-25
rafael palmeiro 's two-out single in the sixth inning scored roberto alomar with the go-ahead run as the baltimore orioles rallied past the california angels 5-4 and took over the american league 's wild-card berth on saturday .
the orioles trailed 4-3 when pinch-hitter mike devereaux led off the sixth with a triple against reliever kyle abbott ( 0-1 ) and scored the tying run on alomar 's single .
after brady anderson sacrificed , palmeiro hit the first pitch into right field for a single , scoring alomar .
in boston , former mariner darren bragg 's first career grand slam in the sixth inning off reliever randy johnson lifted the boston red sox to their fifth win in six games , a 9-5 victory over seattle .
" just one of those things , i was just trying to make contact , " said bragg . "
the bases were loaded and i had two strikes .
i was just trying to put the ball in play .
i got the good part of the bat on it and it carried out . "
in cleveland , kevin seitzer 's two-out single in the top of the 10th brought home david hulse with the winning run as the milwaukee brewers sent the cleveland indians to their third straight extra-inning defeat 4-3 .
bob wickman ( 5-1 ) , acquired from the new york yankees on friday , earned the win in his milwaukee debut despite allowing the tying run in the eighth inning .
at minnesota , marty cordova and matt lawton hit solo homers and frankie rodriguez allowed six hits over seven innings to earn his first win as a starter in a month as the minnesota twins held on to beat the texas rangers 6-5 .
" yeah , you know it 's fun , it 's always fun when you 've got a chance to go to the ballpark and win a game that 's important , " said rodriguez . "
every game should be important , but it 's a little more important now . "
in new york , wally whitehurst allowed two runs over seven innings for his first win in more than two years and paul o'neill 's three-run double snapped a sixth-inning tie as the new york yankees held on for a 5-4 victory over the oakland athletics .

it was his first win since defeating the st. louis cardinals on may 28th , 1994 when he was with the san diego padres .
in kansas city , jose rosado came within one out of his third complete game and michael tucker homered and drove in three runs as the kansas city royals broke a six-game losing streak with a 9-2 victory over the detroit tigers in a battle of cellar-dwellers .

in his last four starts , the 21-year-old left-hander has given up only four earned runs in 29-2/3 innings .

at florida , kevin brown scattered seven hits over eight innings and kurt abbott snapped a sixth-inning tie with a two-run double as the florida marlins defeated the tired cincinnati reds 5-3 .
the marlins won for just the third time in nine games , taking advantage of a reds ' team that has not had a day off since august 8th and was playing its fourth game in 43 hours .
in los angeles , tom candiotti allowed two runs in seven innings and singled home the go-ahead run and mike piazza and todd hollandsworth drove in two runs apiece as the los angeles dodgers defeated the new york mets 7-5 .

soccer - champions porto kick off season with a draw .
lisbon 1996-08-25
portuguese champions porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time .
porto , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by mario jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer domingos oliveira in the 60th minute .
domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time .
setubal , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game , opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked chiquinho conde shot around porto 's new polish keeper andrejez wozniak .
conde scored his second in the 70th minute .
benfica , also playing their first game of the season at home , were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after rodrigo carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence .
benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key brazilian midfielder valdo who suffered a light knee injury .
he was substituted by paulao .
benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by helder after luis baltasar tripped up captain joao pinto under the referee 's nose .
braga defender idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net .

soccer - fiorentina win with batistuta double .
milan 1996-08-25
argentine striker gabriel batistuta gave fiorentina the perfect 70th birthday present on sunday with two goals that gave the italian cup winners a 2-1 supercup victory over serie a champions milan .
the victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the florence club in 1926 , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the cup winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the cup winners had won .
batistuta gave fiorentina the lead in the 11th minute .
sweden 's stefan schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and batistuta did the rest , chipping veteran defender franco baresi and scoring at the near post .
montenegrin midfielder dejan savicevic equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young fiorentina goalkeeper francesco toldo little chance .
the scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , batistuta took charge .
french international midfielder marcel desailly fouled the argentine , whose coach at boca juniors before he joined fiorentina in 1991 was new milan coach oscar tabarez , and batistuta rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out .
the 83rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed batigol by adoring fiorentina fans , was just reward for fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team .
milan 's player of the year george weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while italian team mate roberto baggio did not play due to injury .
new dutch signing edgar davids came on late in the second half as a milan substitute but made little impact .
the league season starts on september 8 .

cycling - ferrigato sprints to second straight world cup win .
zurich 1996-08-25
andrea ferrigato of italy sprinted to his second cycling world cup win in successive weekends with victory in the swiss grand prix on sunday .
ferrigato , winner of the leeds classic last sunday with a one second win over britain 's max sciandri , posted a similarly narrow margin of victory again .
the 26-year-old italian surged past compatriot michele bartoli and last year 's winner and defending world cup champion johan museeuw of belgium in the final few metres of the 237km race .
all three clocked the same time of five hours 51 minutes , 52 seconds .
former world champion lance armstrong of the united states was in front as the leading pack of seven riders turned into the oerlikon velodrome for the final one lap sprint but quickly faded and settled for fourth .
the back-to-back wins vault ferrigato from sixth to second in the overall world cup rankings with 112 points but museeuw continues to hold a commanding lead with 162 points after eight of the 11 rounds .

new delhi 1996-08-25
indian opener navjot singh sidhu was on sunday given a 50-day ban from international cricket for quitting this year 's tour of england , the press trust of india said .
the right-handed batsman will have to forfeit half the money he was due to earn from the tour , the news agency said after a disciplinary committee set up by the board of control for cricket in india met at mohali , near the northern city of chandigarh .
sidhu abandoned the indian team after the third one-day international against england at old trafford in manchester on may 26 , before india began a three-test series , citing serious differences with captain mohammed azharuddin .
azharuddin was sacked after the tour and replaced by sachin tendulkar .
sidhu was not considered for the four-nation singer cup beginning in sri lanka this month and the sahara cup against pakistan scheduled to be played in canada next month .

rugby union - all blacks relive triumph .
pretoria , aug 25 - captain sean fitzpatrick and his all blacks revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over south africa , nzpa reported .
most of the test 15 who beat the springboks 33-26 to secure new zealand 's first-ever rugby series in south africa stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat loftus versfeld .
magnificent , ' ' said fitzpatrick , new zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward .
the players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued .
zinzan brooke , the only no 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against england during last year 's world cup , added a second to his name yesterday .
i was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .
the maul was there and i was going to go in but i thought i should hold off because we had the ball .
when ( halfback ) justin marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where jon preston was so i emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .
i just hit through and i was punching the air before the ball got there .
it cost me a few bucks at the bar . '
'
the decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , brooke said .
it was just like the world cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '
'
centre frank bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .
we were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .
i was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .
there was just so much riding on it .
it 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . '
'
two-try winger jeff wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking bunce where he should be while defending .
he told me i 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' wilson recalled .
about 4000 new zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the south african capital .
messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel .
all blacks coach john hart said prime minister jim bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations .
he thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and i understand we had tremendous support at home . '

south africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers .
anton ferreira
cape town 1996-08-25
south africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands .
leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before archbishop desmond tutu 's truth and reconciliation commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid .
most , including former president f.w. de klerk and african national congress deputy president thabo mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers .
but none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which tutu is investigating .
human rights lawyer brian currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee .
" i do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . "
that was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . "
the commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .
but others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader dirk coetzee , have yet to testify .
tutu 's deputy chairman , alex boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week .
he added that former hardline apartheid president p.w. botha could be among those called .
but currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims .
" a person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee .
at the moment this is not the case . "
he cited coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .
his trial is due to start in december but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .
currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .
last week 's submissions to the commission by the anc , de klerk 's national party and the right-wing freedom front of general constand viljoen left many south africans unsatisfied .
boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared :
" this whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all .
what the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . "
political scientist jannie gagiano said he doubted that the national party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .
" therefore i have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation .
one has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said .
professor tom lodge of the university of the witwatersrand demurred , saying :
" in the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white south africans express about the commission , i think there 's a moral uneasiness , and i think that 's healthy .
responsibility is percolating downwards . "
moslem refugees seek to vote in serb-held town .
samir arnaut
matuzici , bosnia 1996-08-25
thousands of moslem refugees denounced bosnia 's elections as a farce on sunday because serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country .
they said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to serb-held doboj , one of several towns where nato troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived .
the refugees , rallying in matuzici on government territory two km from doboj in northeast bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the united nations and the european union . "
we demand to vote in doboj , " other banners said .
bosnia 's moslem-led central government and many displaced moslems are angered by a key provision of the western-organised september 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . "
as a result , separatist serb authorities have packed former moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other serbs to vote there .
critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure .
" only our physical presence in doboj will mean that the dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , " edhem efendija camdzic , doboj 's islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees .
" the main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said reuf mehemdagic , head of doboj municipality-in-exile .
" eleven thousand serbs who came from elsewhere to doboj will vote there .
how can we then expect the reintegration of bosnia ?
but no one will stop us from returning to our homes . "
mirhunisa komarica , a government refugee official , said : " we want to vote where we were thrown out from .
this is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . "
bosnian vice president ejup ganic , a moslem , told the refugees : " we have a message for the serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . "
to loud applause , he added : " we will enter doboj , untie the doboj knot and ensure free movement for all .
we have to enter doboj to free the serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . "
the dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines .
but local police , controlled by nationalist parties in moslem , serb and croat sectors of bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders .
the majority of refugees from bosnia 's 1992-95 war are moslems from the serb-controlled north and east .
nato-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the doboj area on sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the inter-entity boundary line into doboj .
but the crowd dispersed without incident .
moslems and serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when moslem refugees tried to surge into the town .
eight killed in moscow casino blaze .
moscow 1996-08-25
eight people died on sunday in a blaze at a moscow casino which the fire service said might have been started deliberately , interfax news agency said .
the number of casinos has soared in moscow since the collapse of communism .
the mayor has said he wants to cut their number to five as part of a war against organised crime .
president boris yeltsin signed a decree on fighting crime in july and handed wide-ranging powers to security chief alexander lebed , currently engaged in making peace in breakaway chechnya .
russian troops start pullout , but not in grozny .
shatoi , russia 1996-08-25
russian troops began to pull out from southern chechnya on sunday under a ceasefire agreement between russian security chief alexander lebed and rebel leaders .
but in the capital grozny , the commander of russian interior ministry forces in chechnya , general anatoly shkirko , told interfax news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of chechens disarmed an armoured column .
reuters cameraman liutauras stremaitis said a column of around 40 vehicles , including tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery cannons and lorries , escorted by chechen rebels , pulled out of the village of shatoi towards the border , around 50 km ( 31 miles ) to the north .
in grozny , shkirko told interfax he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the chechens were returned .
chechen rebel spokesman movladi udugov confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of chechens .
he said later that the rebels had handed them over .
the pullout of the russian troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by lebed , which aims to end the 20-month chechnya conflict .
leftist mexican armed group says troops in capital .
mexico city 1996-08-25
the leftist popular revolutionary army ( epr ) in a published report on sunday said it operated throughout mexico , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state .
commanders " vicente " and " oscar " , guarded by a dozen epr gunmen , said in an interview with la jornada outside mexico city that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government .
" they ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from guerrero and as irrational radicals , " commander oscar told la jornada .
they said the erp , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of guerrero on june 28 , had a 23,000-strong membership , but this could not be confirmed independently .
la jornada also reported on sunday that the mexican army has discovered a 37-page , epr manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies .
it quoted the manual as saying : " the objective of the basic course on war is to provide for combatants of the epr basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . "
it was the second time armed " commanders " of the epr have granted interviews outside guerrero state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities .
unlike the better known and unrelated zapatista rebels in southeastern chiapas state , the epr has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports .
there have only been a few skirmishes in guerrero in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured .
ten people gunned down in northwest colombia .
bogota , colombia 1996-08-25
unidentified gunmen dragged 10 men out ot their homes in a rural area of colombia 's northwest province of antioquia and shot them to death , authorities said on sunday .
police said the killings occurred on saturday morning in the municipality of anza but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of medellin early on sunday .
anza is only 20 miles ( 30 km ) west of medellin , but there are no roads linking it directly to the city .
police initially said leftist revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) rebels were prime suspects in the killings .
but gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across antioquia for years , and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group .

two thai border police wounded by burma gunmen .
mae sot , thailand 1996-08-25
two thai border policemen were seriously wounded on sunday when members of a burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest thailand , security officers said .
the two were wounded in the early hours of sunday when some 30 members of the democratic karen buddhist army ( dkba ) ambushed their patrol on the thai side of the border with burma , to the north of the town of mae sot .
the thai army commander in the area , col suvit maenmuan , told reporters the dkba , which is allied with the rangoon military government and based in southeast burma , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration .
suvit said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier .
the dkba was formed in late 1994 by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the anti-rangoon karen national union ( knu ) and allied themselves with burmese government army , their former enemies .
dkba members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on karen refugee camps in thailand , where the majority of inhabitants are knu supporters , and on thai villages and police posts near the border .
bangkok has complained to rangoon about the raids but burmese military authorities say they have no contol over the faction .
thai army commanders reject the explanation , saying they have evidence the burmese army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction .

egypt hopes jars will reveal secrets of mummies .
cairo 1996-08-25
archaeologists in egypt have found pots used by ancient egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification .
mohammed saleh , director of the egyptian museum , told reuters television a u.s. team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in dahshour , a village 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of cairo .
dahshour is the site of egypt 's second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh seneferu more than 4,500 years ago .
saleh said the team -- from new york 's metropolitan museum -- found four canopic jars and two unguent jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the 12th dynasty ( 1991-1786 bc ) in the middle kingdom .
" this finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " saleh said .
" we hope that the analysis of such substances and liquids will reveal some secrets of the mummification process and materials used in this process , " he added .

netanyahu , weizman consult on arafat invitation .
jerusalem 1996-08-25
israeli president ezer weizman , weighing a possible meeting with yasser arafat , consulted on sunday with prime minister benjamin netanyahu , a spokesman said .
weizman and netanyahu met at the president 's official jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said .
earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in israel 's yedioth ahronoth newspaper that weizman had already invited arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the israel-plo peace process .
but the official , aryeh shumer , said it was only fitting that weizman and arafat should talk after the palestinian leader sent the israeli president a letter which yedioth ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces .
the newspaper said netanyahu , who is cool to meeting arafat himself , opposed talks between weizman and the palestinian president .
after moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in israel in february and march , weizman called for peace efforts with the plo to be suspended .
shumer said his current position was that the peace process must continue .

" i am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition -- that you give me a commitment right now to meet arafat yourself within 10 days , " the paper quoted weizman as telling netanyahu .
it said netanyahu had yet to give weizman an answer .
the office of israeli president is largely ceremonial .
but weizman , a former defence minister and an architect of israel 's peace treaty with egypt , has spoken out frequently on the peace process with the palestinians -- at times urging the former labour government to slow it down .
corporate america taking new view on compensation .
anne murray
new york 1996-08-23
corporate america is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study .
what it comes down to is this : if you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely .
but if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less .
the survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm towers perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task .
presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said sandra o'neal , a towers perrin principal .
in the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said .
in addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals .
" the good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , " said o'neal .
" the bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . "
of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result .
next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees .
this coming shift , o'neal said , " is not just isolated or a fad .
it 's an inexorable change . "
after world war ii , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said .
but as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex .
" multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " o'neal said .
now organisations must change to stay competitive .
o'neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises .
if your team does well , you 'll do well .
if it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise .
is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ?
" that 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said o'neal . "
it 's not a question we ask any more .
the more important question is -- ' do we have results ? '
"
to get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education .
companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , o'neal said .
for example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent .
those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success .
" they respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " o'neal said .
" the key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .
it will improve a company 's bottom line . "
belgian police arrest detective in dutroux affair .
geert de clercq
neufchateau , belgium 1996-08-25
investigators arrested a senior police detective on sunday in connection with their inquiries into belgium 's child sex scandal , public prosecutor michel bourlet said .
" georges zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft , insurance fraud and document forgery , " bourlet told a news conference .
he said there had been searches at three sites on sunday , including one at the charleroi judicial police headquarters where zicot worked .
zicot , 45 , is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft .
belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times .
he was promoted to chief detective earlier this year .
bourlet said two other people had also been arrested .
one was gerard pignon , the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored .
the other was insurer thierry dehaan .
bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested .
he said the connection was through bernard weinstein , an accomplice of convicted child rapist marc dutroux -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across europe .
weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo in a house belonging to detroux , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in june 1995 .
two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago .
" dutroux has admitted killing weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft , " bourlet said .
another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained , bourlet added .
anne thily , public prosecutor in the eastern city of liege where julie and melissa lived , said this was a major case involving some 50 investigators -- including two from the u.s. federal bureau of investigation .

19 die as bus falls in river in pakistani kashmir .
muzaffarabad , pakistan 1996-08-25
a bus fell from a mountain road into a river in pakistan-ruled azad ( free ) kashmir on sunday , killing at least 19 people and injuring 11 , police said .
they said dead included five refugees from the indian-ruled part of kashmir , where moslem militants have waged a separatist revolt since early 1990 .
the police said 14 of the 45 passengers on the bus died instantly when the vehicle fell into kunar river from a narrow road leading from the state capital muzaffarabad to the nearby pakistani town of garhi habibullah northwest .
five people died later in hospital .
north afghan highway opening put off , radio says .
islamabad 1996-08-25
the planned reopening of afghanistan 's main northern salang highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until wednesday , official kabul radio said on sunday .
the embattled afghan government said last week that the kabul-salang highway would be opened on monday or tuesday following talks with the supreme coordination council alliance led by jumbish-i-milli movement of powerful opposition warlord general abdul rashid dostum .
the radio said on sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " .
it did not elaborate .
the salang highway , afghanistan 's main route to central asia , has been controlled by dostum since he began fighting president burhanuddin rabbani 's government in kabul in january 1994 in alliance with hezb-i-islami party leader gulbuddin hekmatyar , then prime minister but rival to the president .
hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last june under a peace pact with rabbani and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit .
earlier this month , jumbish denied a kabul government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north .
students burn hasina effigy , battle police .
anis ahmed
dhaka 1996-08-25
students backed by opposition parties battled police and burned an effigy of prime minister sheikh hasina during a strike in the north bangladeshi town of bogra on sunday .
the strikers barricaded streets , attacked the local office of the ruling awami league , fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular " janakantha " newspaper , alleging it was pro-government .
police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said .
the strike , called by the main opposition bangladesh nationalist party ( bnp ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by hasina .
local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on thursday .
hasina told a cross section of people at the bogra police headquarters on sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents .
the prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed , ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged bogra residents to call off the strike .
opposition legislators walked out of parliament in dhaka on sunday denouncing " unprecedented police barbarity " against opposition students and supporters .
they renewed their call for the resignation of home ( interior ) minister rafiqul islam .
hundreds of police raided the dhaka university on sunday , arresting nearly 30 outsiders who had been living in student dormitories and seizing weapons , university officials said .
police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage .
they seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives .
the students were later allowed to return .
the swoop followed the resignation of the university 's vice-chancellor dr. emajuddin ahmed on saturday over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus .
authorities closed down the 28,000-student university on wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police .
police said they fought armed activists from the bnp , headed by former prime minister begum khaleda zia .
hasina told police the home ministry had already given a " blanket order " to arrest terrorists and possessors of illegal firearms irrespective of their political identities .
nearly 100 students have been injured in the clashes in dhaka and bogra , police told reporters .

two died later in hospital .
feature - fertile ukraine faces drought of cash and rain .
irene marushko
batkivshchyna collective farm , ukraine 1996-08-26
four shiny new green-and-yellow john deere combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm .
" they did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said ivan odnosum . "
god help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the ukrainian government bought it earlier this year .
the country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame .
a drought scoured the steppes in may and june , stunting the growing wheat .
and the farming sector , making the painful transition from soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money .
ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " .
but recently ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under soviet dictator josef stalin .
" the wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said hryhory borsuk , a scientist at the mironivka wheat institute , run by the ukrainian academy of agrarian sciences .
" the temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees celsius ( 143.60 fahrenheit ) this summer .
we 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills .
the harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in western ukraine has delayed harvesting there .
while mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to ukraine 's extreme continental climate , borsuk said the lack of cash in ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought .
collective farms and ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed .
this year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence .
the decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful soviet times , when the kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs .
" agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said odnosum .
he said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year .
" we did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , " odnosum said .
a few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-soviet decay .
chief accountant natalya sypron said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance .
the average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , soprun said . "
people are working out of their own dedication . "
borsuk said the farm sector has two options : " we can sit down and cry , or we can do something . "
he said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year .
planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in ukraine 's soil .
further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of ukraine 's arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 .
" if we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , " borkus said .
the government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-soviet days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone .
collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " in the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry .
" collectivisation brought us a lot of pain .
and it went too fast .
privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . "
gencor swells profit despite setbacks .
melanie cheary
johannesburg 1996-08-26
gencor ltd on monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks .
announcing the group 's results for the year ended june 30 , chairman brian gilbertson said : " happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . "
gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group 's impala platinum holdings ltd posting dismal results .
" not everything has gone well .
we 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations .
the most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at impala where we had the furnace failure , " gilbertson said .
implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously .
not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in february / march , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last august .
the rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar .
nor was implats the only operation to fail output targets .
ingwe coal corporation ltd was hit hard by heavy rains .
it forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in mpumulanga province .
but gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the european commission 's blocking of implats ' proposed merger with lonrho plc 's platinum interests .
" the big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger .
from gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " gilbertson said .
looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that gencor would boost earnings further .
" gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future .
the group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses .
i think we can look forward to further growth " .
citing the disposal of gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group malbak ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , gilbertson said gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets .
" we 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets .
the biggest of those was malbak .
overall a very substantial pruning ...
leaving gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , " gilbertson said .
he added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .
referring to gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in ingwe , gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more .
" i think we would have liked to have more of ingwe but it 's the question of adding value .
when we bought the shares we bought ...
at quite a bit lower than the price is now ...
maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . "
finally , gilbertson said a growing proportion of gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .

advanced medical buying ivac medical .
san diego 1996-08-26
advanced medical inc. said monday it will buy ivac medical systems inc. , a former eli lilly & co .
unit , for about $ 400 million in cash , creating one of the world 's largest makers of intravenous infusion therapy products .
under the agreement , ivac and advanced medical 's wholly owned subsidiary , imed corp. , will merge to form a new company that will develop and manufacture infusion pumps that regulate the amount of intravenous fluid being administered to a patient , as well as proprietary disposable products .
the combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 353 million .
advanced medical , through imed , is already one of the nation 's largest developers and manufacturers of intravenous infusion pumps and proprietary disposable products .
it has sales in 38 foreign countries .
san diego-based ivac is a major provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the health-care industry .
it has manufacturing plants in san diego ; creedmoor , n.c. ; hampshire , england ; and tijuana , mexico , and distributes its prodcuts in more than 120 countries .
eli lilly sold ivac on dec. 31 , 1994 to dlj merchant banking partners lp , river medical inc. and other investors .
advanced medical said it expects to take an unspecified one-time charge to pay for the merger .
it did not say when the charge would be taken .
" the addition of ivac is expected to contribute to financial results in the full second quarter of 1997 , " the companies said .
the merger will add to both companies ' historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices , they said .
in 1968 , ivac introduced the world 's first infusion therapy monitoring device .
a year later ivac improved its system with the addition of an iv pump that regulated the flow of liquids through positive pressure .
imed introduced the world 's first volumetric infusion pump in 1974 .
imed had profits of $ 1.7 million , or 6 cents per fully diluted common share , on $ 53.9 million in revenues in the first half of 1996 .
excluding the effect of a one-time restructuring charge of $ 17.4 million , ivac had net income of $ 4.2 million on net sales of $ 112.8 million for the 1996 first half .
advanced medical reported profits of $ 8.4 million on sales of $ 29.2 million in the quarter ended june 30 .
william j. mercer , ivac president and chief executive officer , will become the president and ceo of advanced medical .
he led the transition of ivac to a privately held company and was previously senior vice president at mallinckrodt group inc .
joseph kuhn , advanced medical and imed president , will become the new company 's executive vice president and chief financial officer .
the deal is expected to close by the first quarter of 1997 , subject to regulatory approval .
it has already been approved by both companies ' boards .

tommi makinen took a significant step towards becoming world rally champion with a brilliant victory in the 1000 lakes rally on monday .
mitsubishi driver makinen stopped experienced fellow finn juha kankkunen in his tracks on the final day of the 1,452-km rally , doubling his lead on the first two decisive stages .
" this was the most difficult win - three days at 125 percent effort , " said makinen , whose success completed his 1,000 lakes hat-trick .
kankkunen was runner-up in his toyota as finland 's jarmo kytolehto produced a remarkable drive to finish third in his ford .
swede kenneth eriksson kept subaru in the hunt for the manufacturers ' title with fifth place in spite of a gearbox problem that nearly forced him off the road close to the end of the event .
maakinen 's and mitsubishi 's positions were strengthened by the late retirement of spain 's carlos sainz when his ford gearbox failed .
makinen , with 95 points , now leads his nearest championship rival , sainz , by 32 points .

soccer - sharpe hits winner to ease pressure on leeds .
leeds , england 1996-08-26
winger lee sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give leeds their first win of the season on monday and leave hapless wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the england premier league .
sharpe repaid a huge slice of the 4.5 million pound ( $ 6.98 million ) fee leeds handed manchester united for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand wimbledon their third successive defeat .
ian rush , the welsh striker signed from liverpool in the close season , set up the goal , feeding sharpe as he galloped forward and the former england winger cut inside onto his unfavoured right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net .
the only goal of the match also brought some relief for under-fire leeds manager howard wilkinson following the team 's poor start to the season .
home fans frequently booed their own side until sharpe turned the jeers to cheers .

soccer - seychelles fail in bid for historic victory .
mark gleeson
johannesburg 1996-08-26
the tiny islands of the seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the african nations cup .
trailing fellow indian ocean islanders mauritius 1-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match .
the 2-1 aggregate took mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals , and kept up the seychelles ' record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of fifa membership .
the seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when mauritian midfielder andre caboche was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute .
but the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker ashley mocude scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead .
although danny rose 's 50th-minute equaliser gave the seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated .
mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against malawi , mozambique and favourites zambia .
namibia , who drew 0-0 with botswana in their first leg , won the second leg in windhoek 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the african soccer stage .
they now play in group five with cameroon , gabon and kenya .
german-based striker bachirou salou returned home to togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against congo .
salou , who plays for msv duisburg in the bundesliga , scored in the 53rd minute of sunday 's match in lome for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet liberia , tanzania and zaire .
ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in addis ababa to overcome uganda after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline .
both legs ended 1-1 before ethiopia won the spot kick decider 4-2 .
uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by angola in june 's world cup qualifying preliminaries .
the other preliminary round second leg match , between mauritania and benin in nouakchott , was postponed until friday .
benin won the first leg 4-1 .

swimming - popov in `serious condition ' after stabbing .
moscow 1996-08-26
russian double olympic swimming champion alexander popov was in a serious condition on monday after being stabbed on a moscow street .
a doctor said it was too early to say whether popov , the only man to retain the olympic 50 and 100 metres freestyle titles , would return to top-level sport .
" his condition is serious , " said rimma maslova , deputy chief doctor of hospital no 31 in the russian capital . "
but he is conscious and is talking and smiling . "
maslova told reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine , but said it was too early to judge popov 's chances of returning to competitive swimming .
popov , who won gold in the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the recent atlanta olympics , was stabbed in the abdomen late on saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west moscow .
maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney .
doctors operated on popov , 24 , for three hours .
popov told ntv television on sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . "
there 's no need to worry .
we 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , " he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit .
interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers .
it said the row started when popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party .
vitaly smirnov , president of the russian national olympic committee , said president boris yeltsin had given the swimmer russia 's top award for his olympic performance . "
i am not a doctor but i think he is doing all right , " said smirnov .
smirnov said the olympic committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes , some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in post-soviet russia .

soccer - players leave match early to catch plane .
brian homewood
rio de janeiro 1996-08-26
two key players left a brazilian championship match early on sunday because they had to catch a plane to russia to play with the national team .
sao paulo midfielder andre and santos defender narciso were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to sao paulo airport and flown to rio de janeiro in a private jet chartered by the brazilian football confederation ( cbf ) .
at rio , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to moscow , where brazil will face russia in a friendly international on wednesday .
the problem arose because the sao paulo-santos clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time .
santos suffered more from their loss as narciso 's replacement jean gave away a penalty from which sao paulo scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win .
sao paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package juventude , who beat internacional 2-1 .
corinthians , who played in a tournament in spain last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list .
they were due to leave spain monday night , arrive in sao paulo on tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of curitiba one hour later and then play away to atletico paranaense in the brazilian championship the same evening .
botafogo striker tulio , who was overlooked by zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the netherlands on sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat bahia 2-1 away .
tulio , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year .

tennis - quench your thirst - if you can afford it at u.s. open .
bill berkrot
new york 1996-08-26
a message on television monitors all around the national tennis centre reads : " due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids .
perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . "
a small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched u.s. open is going for $ 3.75 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 -- for water ?
" at the olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the olympics , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the atlanta games had been notorious for price gouging .
u.s. open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw .
when the tournament began on monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended .
" that baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 , " said new yorker rebecca weinstein , a u.s. open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home .
a trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but carol perry chimed in , " the water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . "
indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 .
what 's the message here ? "
maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " perry joked before lifting her glass of wine .
fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries .
and that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty .
make that $ 16.50 .
even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 .
of course , it is served on a tuscan roll .
it must be the cost of flying those rolls over from tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich .
tennis - huber and maleeva fall , up-and-comers advance at open .
larry fine
new york 1996-08-26
martina hingis led a youthful charge and australian open finalist anke huber and magdalena maleeva were fallen seeds on monday in a hot , sunny opening to the u.s. open tennis championships .
the 15-year-old hingis , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last grand slam on stadium court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked angeles montolio of spain .
" it was very hot and i did n't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched spaniard .
hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at flushing meadows were the sixth-seeded huber of germany and 12th seed maleeva of bulgaria .
huber , who lost to monica seles in the australian open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater amanda coetzer of south africa .
coetzer , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to huber in the australian open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 .
" i looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said coetzer , 24 . "
i was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm .
" she is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down .
she played one great game and than a few errors .
the challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . "
huber , who reached the final a week ago at manhattan beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw .
" i was n't happy when i saw the draw .
she was the first non- seeded player , " said the 21-year-old german . "
it 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a grand slam .
" i think i did n't play that bad today .
it was maybe my best first round match in a grand slam i ever played . "
monday brought the best out in u.s. open rookie aleksandra olsza of poland , ranked 110th .
the 18-year-old olsza , last year 's wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the open by removing maleeva 6-4 6-2 .
the curtain-raising victories by hingis and olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks .
the swiss teenager , a twice french open junior champion and a wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's australian open .
" i hope i can get into the last 16 , " said hingis , seeded to face third seed arantxa sanchez vicario in the fourth round .
hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships .
" there will be tough matches but i hope i can get there , " she said . "
then we 'll see if arantxa will be there , too . "
the fast-moving olsza , 18 , was cool in her opening match .
" i was n't scared when i heard that i was playing maleeva , " said olsza . "
i know that if i want to play professional tennis i have to do my best to try to beat her and i ca n't be scared . "
olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros .
" in terms of tennis , i think the junior players are really good now .
in a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . "
two big-serving women 's players made quick work of japanese opponents .
brenda schultz-mccarthy of the netherlands , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over japan 's nana miyaga , while czech veteran helena sukova prevailed over yone kamio 6-2 6-3 .
austrian barbara paulus , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over yi jing-qian of china .
tennis - stich glad he stayed after open victory .
richard finn
new york 1996-08-26
michael stich nearly pulled out of the u.s. open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on monday over qualifier tommy haas .
" i still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and i was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' that 's it , ' " said stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week .
" but there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that i decided to stay . "
in a break from tradition , the open did not seed in strict accordance with atp rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward u.s. players .
one prominent player that did not stay for the open was french open champion yvegeny kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his atp ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to russia .
kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury .
at a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on sunday , u.s. davis cup player todd martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .
" the way the u.s. open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this u.s. open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " martin said .
stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest .
" i feel that we made it a little easy for the usta .
they did n't really get hurt as much as i think they should have , " said stich . "
i feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . "
but once the 27-year-old stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last grand slam .
he took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot haas on a sun-baked grandstand court .
others advancing early on monday included 11th-seeded american malivai washington , the wimbledon runner-up , sweden 's magnus gustafsson , and two-time former french open champion sergi bruguera of spain , who will be stich 's next opponent .
the suspicion , however , lingers in stich 's mind that u.s. open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .
" i get the feeling that everything is done here for the american players and they forget about all the other players , " said stich , who lost the 1994 open final to andre agassi .
it was agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on wednesday .
the flamboyant american star was bumped up two spots from his atp ranking of eight to a seeding of six .
" he ( agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said stich about the unfairness of moving up agassi , who made early exits from the french open and wimbledon .
stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after kafelnikov withdrew .
ranked 18th in the world , stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of spain 's felix mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the open and had been left out of the seedings originally .
but stich did n't want to play that game .
" i think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , " stich said .

i knew i would score even if he fielded it cleanly , he could n't throw me out . "

baseball - bonds ' consecutive game streak ends .
san francisco 1996-08-25
san francisco giants all-star left fielder barry bonds did not appear in sunday 's 7-2 victory over the montreal expos , ending his consecutive games streak .
after appearing as a pinch-hitter in the previous two games , bonds , who has been battling a hamstring injury , did not see any action today , ending his streak at 357 consecutive games .
it was the second-longest streak by an active player in the the majors behind baltimore 's cal ripken , who appeared in his major-league record 2,282nd straight game today , a 13-0 loss to the california angels .
bonds has been limited to a pinch-hitting role since an mri friday showed a mild strain of his left hamstring .
bonds came out of wednesday 's game against new york in the ninth inning after suffering a mild hamstring strain .
he was back in the starting lineup thursday night and went 1-for-2 before exiting in the third inning .
the 32-year-old bonds is hitting .307 with 35 homers and 107 rbi and has been one of the few bright spots for the last-place giants .
chicago cubs outfielder sammy sosa had the third-longest streak at 304 games , but that ended earlier this week when he suffered a broken bone in his right hand .
atlanta braves first baseman fred mcgriff owns the second-longest streak at 295 games .

osce delays decision on refugee voting .
kurt schork
sarajevo 1996-08-26
bosnia 's election organisers will decide on tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an osce spokeswoman said on monday .
officials from the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of serb refugees .
international observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies .
" tomorrow ...
the provisional election commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ...
the other elections will be held on september 14 , " osce spokeswoman agota kuperman told reporters in sarajevo .
" i think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled .
i think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections ..
. "
kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were .
the dayton peace agreement gave the osce a mandate to organise bosnian elections .
the provisional election commission is osce 's top rule-making body for the poll .
more than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of bosnia 's total electorate .
they are due to begin voting on wednesday , august 28 , just one day after the pec is supposed to make its decision .
balloting inside bosnia is scheduled for september 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate moslem-croat and serb parliaments , a national house of representatives and a three-man presidency .
a sarajevo daily newspaper , dnevi avaz , which is close to bosnia 's moslem nationalist sda party , on monday said the osce would postpone the municipal-level elections until the spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems .
sda has a representative on the provisional election commission .
" i do n't know what the source of the dnevi avaz report is , but it is consistent with what i have heard from western diplomats and from inside the osce , " said an osce staff member in sarajevo who asked not to be named .
" the word is that frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the pec on tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . "
ambassador robert frowick , an american , heads the osce mission in bosnia .
osce and independent monitors allege that serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war .
instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had moslem majorities before the 43-month bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " .
diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure serb control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of bosnia known as the serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war .
the top u.n. refugee official in the balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on monday .
" results of the registration for september elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in bosia-hercegovina , " warned soren jessen-petersen , special envoy for the u.n. high commissioner for refugees in former yugoslavia .
" in the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . "
after truce , lebed faces tougher chechen problem .
alastair macdonald
moscow 1996-08-26
alexander lebed may finally get to discuss his chechen peace proposals with boris yeltsin on tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels .
it could be a sobering experience for the kremlin security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend .
despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and moscow 's insistence that chechnya remain part of russia , will be no easy matter .
a chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held chechen capital grozny .
he returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed .
but then he apparently thought better of it .
saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in moscow -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on sunday .
he met russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin on monday and , according to the press service of lebed 's security council , could meet yeltsin on tuesday .
it was not clear if the start of yeltsin 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk .
moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on chechnya 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments .
it is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan .
speculation mounted last week that lebed was operating out on a limb in chechnya as yeltsin , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce .
but chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff aslan maskhadov had been agreed by yeltsin .
if that were the case , it was unclear why lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in moscow .
lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in moscow , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him .
maskhadov warned that lebed risked the same fate as a former russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the chechens say -- russian forces .
maskhadov may also have made new demands on lebed , forcing him to check back with the kremlin on what he could offer .
a rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date .
chernomyrdin said voters should decide chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the russian federation -- something moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic north caucasus .
lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war .
yeltsin on holiday from monday - interfax .
moscow 1996-08-26
russian president boris yeltsin began a new summer holiday on monday but would remain in control of affairs of state , interfax news agency said .
" the head of state 's holiday has only just begun , " the agency quoted sergei yastrzhembsky as saying , adding that the president was currently in a kremlin residence near moscow .
interfax said yastrezhembsky did not exclude that yeltsin could spend some time in other places .
he would continue working on various documents and might meet " one state offical or another " .
" one must give b. yeltsin a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections , " interfax quoted yastrezhembsky as saying .
" ( yeltsin ) controls internal and international policies , daily receives a big packet of documents from moscow , which demand his intervention ...
many of those documents return to the president 's administration the same day , " he said .
yeltsin went on a two-day trip outside moscow last week to check out a holiday home .
yugo zastava workers ' protest enters 2nd week .
belgrade 1996-08-26
thousands of workers of serbia 's zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production .
" we are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory 's trade union secretary dragutin stanojlovic .
" we are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . "
trade unions demanded payment of june and july wages and last year 's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant .
the former yugoslav national army consumed 90 percent of zastava 's pre-war output , but like the rest of yugoslavia 's economy , the new army of serbia and montenegro is crippled by lack of funds .
in kragujevac where the plant is based , 9,000 to 10,000 people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what stanojlovic called government indifference .
the ruling socialist party last week accused serbia 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests .
" late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local socialist party branch told reuters .
" but there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . "
federal yugoslav elections are due on november 3 .
the party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated . "
there were about 1,400 to 1,600 people at the protest today -- much less then last week .
" but there were more observers and passers by , " he said .

svcd bulgaria air traffic controllers to strike september 3 .
sofia 1996-08-26
bulgarian air traffic controllers will go on strike on september 3 demanding higher pay , the chief of the bulgarian association of air traffic controllers ( bulatka ) said on monday .
stefan raichev told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 1,380 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 10 percent since last year .
more than 1,500 planes per day fly over bulgaria , in a strategic location between europe and the middle and the far east , raichev said .
the director general of the air traffic service valentin valkov said last friday that a controllers ' strike would be illegal .
valkov said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier balkan airlines , which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the bulgarian black sea resorts .
but raichev said it would be " discrimination " against the other airlines if only balkan planes were guided in .
" under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights , " raichev said .
raichev said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak english .
the controllers are demanding the monthly wage be increased to $ 1,000 per month from the current $ 230 , as well as the resignation of the air traffic service 's management .
they also demand the financial separation of the 350 air controllers from the technical staff .

kidnappers have seized a dutch couple who manage a farm in northern costa rica and have demanded a $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said on monday .
officials said humberto hueite zyrecha and his wife jetty kors , both 50 , were kidnapped late on saturday or early sunday .
col .
misael valerio , head of border police at the security ministry , told reporters surveillance of the northern border with nicaragua has been stepped up to keep the kidnappers from fleeing costa rica .
preliminary reports said the couple were kidnapped on the " altamira " farm , owned by dutchman richard wisinga , at aguas zarcas de san carlos near the costa rica-nicaragua border .
unconfirmed news reports said a vehicle belonging to them was found abandoned at santa maria de pocosol , about 12 miles ( 20 km ) north of the site of the abduction .
the reports said authorities found a statement , supposedly from the kidnappers , in the vehicle , addressed to wisinga and demanding a $ 1.5 million ransom .
wisinga was believed to be travelling in europe , they said .

the firm also revised down its year-end peso forecast to 7.85-8.15 per dollar from 8.20-8.50 .
it forecast an end 1997 peso in the range of 9.20-9.40 .

it bumped up its average interest rate projection in 1997 to 25.8 percent from 23 percent .
fiscal policy was expected to be loosened a bit in the second half of this year , boosting growth without running into a deficit .

colombian peso closes lower , importers buy dlrs .
bogota 1996-08-26
colombia 's peso closed lower at 1,044 after coming under pressure from dollar-buying by importers seeking to meet their commitments abroad , interbank dealers said .
it was the second consecutive session that saw the peso , which ended at 1,041 friday , close lower .
" the ( dollar 's ) rise was due to demand from importers who have a lot of wire transfers accumulated , " one dealer said .
contributing to the peso 's weakness , another dealer said banks who might have sold greenbacks in monday 's trading appeared to shy away from the market .
this , according to the trader , was typical of month-end position-squaring -- and the fact that a stronger u.s. currency helps limit some foreign exchange losses .
dealers reported 355 trades for a total of $ 142 million and said the peso hit an intra-day high of 1,037 before heading lower into the close .

he had earlier visited japan , south korea and china .
specter said after the bombing there should be a shake-up at the pentagon and questioned whether perry should resign .
he said he was not satisfied with some of perry 's answers to the committee 's questions in closed testimony last month .
the question of whether perry should resign remained open , the pennsylvania republican said .
fbi director louis freeh , who has twice visited saudi arabia to seek improved cooperation with saudi investigators , told the committee he was not entirely satisfied with saudi cooperation on the dhahran bomb and a previous bomb attack in riyadh .
" if we 're to stay in saudi arabia , we need to have total cooperation , " specter said .
the united states has 5,000 u.s. air force and other military personnel in saudi arabia .

larnaca , cyprus 1996-08-27
a sudan airways plane with 199 passengers and crew which was hijacked to cyprus took off from larnaca airport after refuelling and headed to britain early on tuesday , witnesses said .

kurds clash again in iraq , dozens reported dead .
ankara 1996-08-26
heavy fighting broke out between two rival kurdish factions in northern iraq at midnight sunday and at least 29 people were killed , one of the groups said on monday .
the kurdistan democratic party ( kdp ) said the patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) had broken the u.s.-brokered ceasefire agreed between the two parties last week .
the factions reached a ceasefire on friday after a week of fierce fighting which had put an end to a truce agreed a year earlier .
" the puk leadership who pledged to end fighting and cooperate with the latest u.s. initiative started a major military offensive against kdp positions , " the kdp said in a statement .
it said heavy fighting started at midnight in the region dividing the two warring factions , with the puk aiming to break through to kdp 's headquarters in salahuddin .
the kdp said 29 puk fighters were killed in the attack .
it did not provide details of kdp casualties and a puk spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
the statement said the puk resumed its attack on monday morning on kdp positions near rawandouz and indiscriminately shelled the town of dayana , killing a priest and injuring some civilians .
the fighting has threatened a u.s.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous kurdish region in northern iraq against president saddam hussein .
a u.s.-led air force has protected iraqi kurds against attack from baghdad since shortly after the gulf war in 1991 .
egypt to press britain over islamist conference .
cairo 1996-08-26
egypt will tell britain it is concerned about a meeting of islamists to be held in london soon , foreign minister amr moussa said on monday .
" there is a question mark over this issue .
we , and many other countries , do n't understand this ( britain 's ) position , " moussa told reporters .
" egypt will contact the british government to find out the truth of the matter and to discuss the possible consequences of such an unfortunate step , " he added .
egyptian government newspapers have criticised britain for allowing islamists , whom they brand as " terrorists " , to hold their conference , saying the meeting will be a chance for dangerous moslem militants to plot against their countries of origin .
it is not clear when the conference will be held .
about 1,000 people have been killed in egypt since islamic militants took up arms in 1992 in an attempt to overthrow the government and set up a strict islamic state .
cairo says several egyptian militants on the run from death sentences or convictions for violent attacks at home have taken shelter in britain .
israeli army ransacks bedouin palestinian camp .
al-muntar , west bank 1996-08-26
israeli security forces ransacked a bedouin encampment in the west bank on monday to expel them from an area which palestinians say had been earmarked for jewish settlement expansion , residents said .
they said soldiers stole a gold necklace and about $ 2,000 in israeli currency from an elderly woman and her daughter-in-law while rummaging through their luggage before destroying family shacks and animal barns .
" they rammed our shacks with jeeps and destroyed the shack over my baby , " said 25-year-old amina muhammad . "
he was saved only by a miracle . "
a spokesman for israel 's civil administration in the west bank said the bedouins were moved because they were encamped on an israeli army firing zone .
the spokesman peter lerner said he knew nothing about soldiers having stolen anything from the palestinians .
israeli security forces have been pursuing bedouin palestinians living in the desolate wilderness between east jerusalem and the dead sea , where several jewish settlements have been established .
the israeli army also uses the area for military training .

two younger brothers found him hanging from a tree early monday morning .
his father cut him down and tried to revive him but paramedics pronounced him dead when they arrived .
the broward county sheriff 's office found a step stool and a flashlight under the tree where the boy was hanged .
they said there was no sign of foul play and that investigators believed the death was a suicide .

u.s. midwest hog market seen steady tuesday - trade .
chicago 1996-08-26
midwest direct cash hog prices tuesday were seen steady following strong demand monday that lifted prices as much as $ 1.50 per cwt in some areas , livestock dealers said .
the demand was sparked by saturday 's active slaughter , which left some packers short on supplies to get monday operations started , they said .
top prices in iowa / southern minnesota tuesday were expected to range from mostly $ 59.50 to $ 60.00 , steady following a $ 0.50 - $ 1.50 jump monday .
illinois tops were seen matching monday 's at $ 59.00 with tops in indiana at $ 57.50 .
however , usda reported tops of $ 58.00 in illinois and in iowa / southern minnesota , $ 60.00 on some hogs monday .
attempts to move prices higher again tuesday could be offset by expected increased hog marketings this week , sources said .
producers were expected to ship as many hogs as they can ahead of the labor day holiday weekend , they said .
demand for hogs is expected to be light by the end of the week , as the industry prepares for labor day , monday , september 1 when most u.s. packers will be closed .

gore presents new image of lead attack dog .
michael posner
chicago 1996-08-26
no more mild-mannered and meek al gore , the vice president and likely heir apparent to president bill clinton , emerged on monday as the new democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on bob dole and house speaker newt gingrich .
while clinton takes a train trip to the democratic convention that will renominate him on wednesday for a second term , gore is the bright star in the convention city now .
crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream " 12 more years " -- a wishful hope to eight years of gore after a clinton re-election .
over a 15-hour span from sunday evening to monday morning , so many people jammed gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of congress , reporters and others from entering a pro-israel rally and a meeting of the new york delegation .
in his appearances , the often stiff and wooden gore seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing " pol " as he ripped into republican presidential nominee dole and gingrich , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of democrats .
gore told a roaring labor rally of about 1,000 union workers that dole and gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil , without even mentioning that former housing secretary jack kemp is dole 's running mate .
" with equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of dole and gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , " gore said to whoops of " 12 more years . "
" they want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't , " he added . "
they want to silence your voices in elections . "
at a downtown hotel monday , the 48-year-old gore gave wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new gore .
" i want you to ask this question .
what would wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition , the gingrich / dole congress , also controlled the executive branch ? "
gore said .
noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three supreme court justice nominations , he warned , " their extremist agenda would come out of the gingrich congress , into and through the dole white house , down through the supreme court . "
he painted a scene of horrors he saw if republicans controlled the white house and the congress they hold now . "
our personal and religious liberties would be at risk .
medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine .
medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children .
education would be at risk .
the environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said .
his new style mixed an assault on republicans with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds wisconsin stronger , that builds america stronger .
with your help we can re-elect bill clinton . "
dole 's tax cut plans were called " deja-voodoo economics .... it 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch .
we got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . "
gore ridiculed dole 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised clinton for " courage " in advancing regulations of it .
to the delegates of wisconsin , a leading dairy state , gore had the right audience in poking fun at dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk .
" some people say milk is bad for you , " gore said as wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow .
he praised clinton for vetoing the republican congress ' attempt to repeal parts of the clean air act , and criticized republicans for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . "
" the choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " gore said . "
we 're not going to let them get away with that . "
actor reeve highlights democrats ' first night .
chicago 1996-08-26
the highlights of the first day of the democratic convention on monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity .
among the latter were gun control advocate sarah brady and actor christopher reeve and the politicians included rep .
richard gephardt and sen .
thomas daschle .
here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key monday speakers .
sarah brady -- the nation 's toughest gun control law is named after ronald reagan 's press secretary james brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage .
as head of handgun control inc. , sarah brady , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then president reagan in 1981 .
her reward was the passage in 1993 of the " brady bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers .
reagan recovered fully from his wounds but brady , who was close to death after being shot by john hinckley jr .
, suffered serious brain damage .
sarah was brady 's second wife and they have a son , james scott brady jr .
before the assassination attempt , she had worked for republican congressmen and for the republican party .
christopher reeve -- reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life .
reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in culpepper , virginia , on may 27 , 1995 .
almost entirely paralyzed , reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine .
that allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position .
over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the democratic national convention .
reeve , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man .
he performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " superman " and three sequels .
richard gephardt -- gephardt , house democratic leader , is a politician with a " mr clean " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job .
gephardt , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of st. louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly house democrats .
a former lawyer , he was in the front line of president bill clinton 's battle with the republican-led congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the republican-written welfare reform bill .
he advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut u.s. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing .
he was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for president ronald reagan 's big tax cut bill .
gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator .
his 1988 bid for the democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers .
tom daschle -- daschle , 48 , was largely unknown outside washington and his state of south dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become senate democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the republicans in 1994 .
a mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the senate in 1987 , he presented himself as a midwest moderate , as a democratic winner in a republican state able to unite senate factions .
concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced republican leader bob dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage .
in his early senate years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by agent orange defoliant spraying in the vietnam war .
daschle was a key player in president bill clinton 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the white house .
he has made clear he opposed clinton 's signing of the republican-initiated welfare reform bill .
he has spent his adult life in politics , coming to congress as an aide in 1972 after three years in the air force and then being elected to the house of representatives himself in 1978 .
u.s. boy , 13 , accused of murdering adoptive mother .
dallas 1996-08-26
a 13-year-old dallas boy has been charged with murdering his adoptive mother over the weekend , police said on monday .
margaret mccullough , 55 , was found dead in her home on saturday with gunshot wounds to the head .
police , who at first thought her son had been kidnapped , found him on sunday with a friend in his mother 's car in oklahoma and arrested him .
a shotgun and a .357 handgun were found in the car .
a police spokesman said the boy was being questioned . "
they are talking to him now about the motive and everything else . "
mccullough had adopted the boy , who was the grandson of her late husband , shortly after his birth but neighbours said they often had loud arguments .
pakistani bourse to use new recomposed index .
karachi , pakistan 1996-08-26
the karachi stock exchange ( kse ) said on monday it would introduce a new recomposed kse-100 index on september 10 .
a kse statement said the recomposed index would be more representative , capturing market capitalisation of 82.3 percent , up from 79.9 percent previously .

nwe oil products mixed , holiday dulls trade .
london 1996-08-26
nwe oil products were mixed on monday but markets were becalmed because of a public holiday in the united kingdom , traders said .
an explosion at repsol 's puertollano refinery , which killed four workers , had not affected output of oil products , an official said .
" the plant is functioning as usual , " jose manuel prieto , director of personnel , told spanish state television .
gasoline prices were notionally unchanged from friday despite sagging nymex numbers , with the arbitrage window to the u.s. considered closed for the moment .
eurograde barges were offered at $ 207 fob ara for amsterdam-rotterdam barrels , and at $ 206 for full ara material .
" there is no market at the moment , " one rotterdam trader said . "
maybe sentiment is a little bit weaker but prices have not changed . "
outright gas oil prices were notionally softer as the nymex heating oil contract headed lower , and following news that the indian oil corp ( ioc ) had issued a tender to buy only 120,000 tonnes of high speed diesel for october .
asian traders had earlier expected an ioc tender for around 400,000 tonnes .
ara gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 1 a tonne over september ipe for prompt barrels , while antwerp material was available for 0-50 cents over september .
the ioc tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one german player said .
fuel oil markets were also listless .
offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ 102 fob ara but bids were scarce .

brush wellman comments on beryllium lawsuits .
cleveland 1996-08-26
brush wellman inc said monday that 10 of 24 lawsuits involving chronic beryllium disease have been dismissed since july 1 .
the leading u.s. beryllium producer said in a conference call it has traditionally been pro-active regarding the workplace disease , a lung ailment which can affects a small percent of people whose immune systems are susceptible .

" brush wellman has been a leader in dealing with health and safety issues ( related to chronic beryllium disease ) for nearly 50 years , " he said . "
we have a record of going beyond regulatory requirements ... and we consistently share the most current information available ... with customers and employees . "

chelsea makes political debut on clinton train trip .
chillicothe , ohio 1996-08-25
- chelsea clinton , until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life , made her political debut on sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip .
chelsea , 16 , was at president bill clinton 's side as he rode the rails through parts of west virginia , kentucky and ohio , and was introduced at every stop .
she even worked ropelines , shaking hands with excited fans .
hillary rodham clinton saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in huntington , west virginia and then went on to chicago to begin a rigorous democratic convention schedule .
asked if chelsea would have a prominent role in the campaign , white house spokesman mike mccurry said : " she 'll do what she did today when she can .
she has to go back to school . "
the president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at sidwell friends school , a private school in washington .
mccurry said chelsea has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated , but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career .
chelsea " is a very poised young lady , but she 's not that much interested in politics , " the spokesman said .
dutch closing share market report .
amsterdam 1996-08-26
dutch shares drifted to a lower close on monday , dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the uk bank holiday and lack of any significant u.s. economic data .
the aex index of leading shares closed 4.54 points easier at 556.19 , the day 's low .
the dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to wall street did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said .
" it was always going to be a tough day with participation so low .
but the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds , and that dragged us lower , " one dealer said .
stocks were down across the board , with dutch ptt topping the volume list and closing down 1.90 guilders at 58.70 .
the post and telecoms firm posted an 8.5 percent rise in first half earnings on friday , just below analysts ' expectations .
ihc caland reported first half results well under forecasts on monday and the shares suffered as a result .
they were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 2.40 guilders down at 80.70 after it reported net profits of 34.9 million guilders against 36.6 million last year and estimates ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 million .
ihc also forecast post tax earnings rising 21 percent for the full year .

but nutricia shrugged off its ex-div tag to soar a further 4.10 guilders to 214.40 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 51 percent jump in first half net profits last week , which set the market alight on friday , sending the shares up 18.40 at 210.00 by the close .

tapie to quit french assembly seat as film opens .
paris 1996-08-26
former businessman and soccer boss bernard tapie said that he would give up his seat in the national assembly by wednesday , the day a film by claude lelouche in which he stars opens in france .
" i will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview .
" just about , " he told europe 1 radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to assembly speaker philippe seguin .
a seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received .
tapie , 53 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the assembly following a finding by the supreme court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period .
tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the marseille soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in lelouche 's " homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( men , women : instructions for use ) .
he plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by lelouche , who is making his 35th film .
" i have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " tapie said . "
in france , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time .
that is why i will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . "
justice minister jacques toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting tapie from the french parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the european parliament .
the french procedure was expected to be completed before october 2 , when the national assembly is to reconvene after a summer break , but the european procedure was expected to take longer .
tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the european court of human rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his european seat .
but such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the french judgement against him .
tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match .
he is appealing in both cases to the supreme court .

rabobank [ rabn.cn ] sees h2 net growth under 10 pct .
amsterdam 1996-08-26
dutch co-operative bank rabobank nederland ba 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 10 year percent in the second half of 1996 , executive board chairman herman wijffels said on monday .
the unlisted bank earlier announced a 1996 interim net profit of 853 million guilders , up 21.5 percent on the 702 million guilders reported in the first half of 1995 .
he said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans , which was already easing , and the performance of financial markets , which were strong in the first half and boosted securities , trading and underwriting income .
" we expect reasonable growth in the second half .
maybe it will be in single-digits , " wijffels told reuters .
he said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace .
rabobank 's net profit was 1.43 billion guilders in 1995 .
the bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment .
but wijffels was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services .

thai pm proposes sept 18 for no-confidence debate .
bangkok 1996-08-26
thai prime minister banharn silpa-archa on monday proposed september 18 as the date for parliamentary debate on an opposition no-confidence motion accusing him of incompetence .
the president of parliament had earlier said september 11 could be set for the debate .
the opposition motion against banharn accuses him of being incompetent , lacking ethical leadership and alleges his administration is corrupt .
his critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate .
banharn has denied the accusations and said he is ready to clear himself in parliament .
" in my opinion september 18 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions .
this has nothing to do with the accusation that i am trying to escape the debate , " banharn told reporters after meeting coalition partners .
banharn 's 13-month-old , six-party coalition government controls 209 seats in the 391-seat lower house of parliament .
political infighting within banharn 's chart thai party has raised doubts whether he can hold his supporters together and defeat the opposition motion , political analysts said .
" we are still waiting to fix a date .
september 18 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda , " said an official at parliament 's agenda section .
the last no-confidence debate against banharn 's coalition in may was won by the government .

u.n. official ekeus heads for baghdad .
manama 1996-08-26
senior united nations arms official rolf ekeus left bahrain for baghdad on monday for talks with iraqi officials , a u.n. spokesman said .
the spokesman said ekeus , chairman of the united nations special commission ( unscom ) , would spend two or three days in iraq but declined to give further details .
u.n. oficials have said ekeus would hold talks with iraqi deputy prime minister tareq aziz and other officials as part of an agreement iraq reached with the united nations in june to hold higher level political talks with ekeus .
the security council on friday asked iraq to stop blocking arms inspectors search for concealed weapons or materials they believe were being shuttled around to avoid detection .
disarming iraq of weapons of mass destruction under 1991 gulf war ceasefire terms is a prerequisite before the lifting of crippling sanctions imposed on iraq in 1990 for invading kuwait .

focus - eurobourses end mixed but london recovers .
leonard santorelli
london 1996-08-27
european bourses closed mixed on tuesday with london clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall street , hit by inflation worries .
the dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important japanese tankan economic survey out on wednesday .
but it recovered at the close of trade .
stocks in london started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the ftse index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground .
tuesday 's patchy showing in london followed a string of records last week , culminating in friday 's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of european interest rate cuts .
the london bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on wall street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected august consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling u.s. treasuries back from their early peaks .
shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in august from a revised 107.0 in july , wall street relinquished virtually all its morning gains .
" treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , " said alan ackerman , market strategist at fahnestock & co . "
consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . "
frankfurt was the one bright spot in europe .
floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised ibis index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . "
the market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader .
french shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said .
bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since august 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak u.s. currency lifted the mark and squeezed french investments .
the dollar , which dropped sharply on monday because of jitters over the japanese tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to monday 's levels .
" besides the tankan , there 's nothing really until the u.s. jobs numbers next week , " said a uk bank corporate dealer . "
there is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . "
foreign exchange markets regard the tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction .
if it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in japanese interest rates will evaporate .
the japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .
the dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against european currencies amid renewed concerns over europe 's economic and monetary union ( emu ) timetable .
currencies
the dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of european trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on monday .
stock markets
the financial times-stock exchange index of 100 leading british shares ended 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7 .

more hostages freed from hijacked sudanese plane .
stansted , england 1996-08-27
armed hijackers believed to be iraqis released between 60 and 70 people on tuesday from a sudan airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in london after being diverted on a flight from khartoum to amman , authorities said .
a spokesman for stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a british-based member of the iraqi community association , called mr sadiki , and that police were trying to trace him .
police spokeswoman kim white said police had already contacted sadiki and were trying to arrange to bring him to stansted , 30 miles ( 48 km ) north-east of london , to talk to the hijackers .
the airport spokesman said the six hijackers , who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , were believed to be iraqi nationals .
the hijackers started to release people for the airbus plane in batches of 10 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a " controlled release " .
police said most of the passengers were sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of iraqis , jordanians , palestinians , syrians and saudis .
later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80 .
feature - " eco terrorists " target uk builders .
edna fernandes
london 1996-08-27
ecological warfare has broken out across the british construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins .
described by one british company as " eco-terrorism " , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s .
famous names like tarmac plc , costain group plc and arc , a unit of conglomerate hanson plc , have all been targeted .
activist groups are no longer seen by british firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies .
" you only have to see them in action at protests , " said david harding , spokesman at arc , hanson 's aggregates company . "
they walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . "
one road protestor under the codename steady eddie told construction journal " building " earlier this year , " if it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . "
as well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used .
costain 's contract to build the controversial newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive alan lovell 's home .
a costain spokesman told reuters : " we 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house .
but it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . "
tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic berkshire wood elves , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation .
other larger activist groups include earth first , the land is ours , alarm uk and road alert .
the groups have targeted specific projects like the newbury bypass and the m3 motorway through twyford down in the southern county of hampshire .
but they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities .
the government has slashed its road-building spending .
although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological .
graham watts , chief executive of the construction industry council , said : " i do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project .
" but they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago .
there 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . "
he says the damage comes in two forms : " tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . "
watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract .
" i do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . "
arc says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself .
its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the newbury bypass .
" it was called the " first battle of the newbury bypass ' , " said arc 's harding .
" we had 300 earth first protestors invade and occupy our site .
hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day .
plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . "
simon brown , analyst at investement bank ubs , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk .
" when talking to tarmac about the m3 link ( through twyford down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . "
harding says others have done the same . "
as a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . "
for an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe .
london carnival ends in high spirits .
london 1996-08-26
london 's annual notting hill carnival , the largest in europe and second in the world only to rio , ended peacefully on monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits .
police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings .
but there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured .
around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering .
shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .

golf - players divided on cart request for olazabal .
northampton , england 1996-08-27
seve ballesteros and colin montgomerie are divided on whether jose maria olazabal should be allowed to return to the european pga tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course .
the spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in bordeaux , france from october 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy .
" if the ( tour 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule i would not be against it , " said ballesteros , olazabal 's compatriot and ryder cup captain .
but commitee member montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . "
i know olly 's situation is very unfortunate , but i do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . "
you 've got to have a rule for everybody and i do n't think it 's feasible . "
the use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if olazabal is allowed to use one in bordeaux , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's ryder cup .

cricket - gooch to play another season for essex .
london 1996-08-27
graham gooch , the 43-year-old former england captain , is to continue playing county cricket for at least another season , his club essex announced on tuesday .
opener gooch 's decision comes towards the end of a season in which he has underlined his consistency by becoming the leading scorer in essex 's history , beating keith fletcher 's aggregate of 29,434 .
gooch , who retired from test cricket after the 1994-95 tour of australia but is now an england selector , is seventh in this season 's first-class averages with 1,429 runs at 64.95 , having hit five centuries and one double century .
essex secretary-general manager peter edwards said : " he is a remarkable batsman and still the best in this country .
no-one will argue with that .
you just have to look at his record to appreciate that fact . "
soccer - romania club boss banned for headbutt .
bucharest 1996-08-27
the romanian soccer federation has banned first division club jiul petrosani 's president miron cozma for two years for headbutting a visiting team player , a federation statement said .
romania 's soccer bosses also fined cozma , a well-known miners ' union leader , 10 million lei ( $ 3000 ) for the half-time attack on dinamo bucharest 's danut lupu last sunday .
miners led by cozma rioted in bucharest in 1990 and 1991 , bringing down the reformist government of premier petre roman .
cozma is awaiting trial for assault and criminal damage in a bar in his home town of petrosan , 300 kms west of bucharest .
the attack on lupu came during a tunnel skirmish between opposing players as they left the field .
" cozma 's blow was not too painful because i 'm a tall man , " lupu told reuters on tuesday .
lupu is one of the tallest players in romania 's first division , towering over cozma by some 17 cms ,
jiul petrosani , promoted to the first division this year , won the league game 1-0 .
cozma is barred from taking part in any official soccer activity during the ban .

tennis - edberg extends grand slam run , topples wimbledon champ .
larry fine
new york 1996-08-27
stefan edberg produced some of his vintage best on tuesday to extend his grand run at the grand slams by toppling wimbledon champion richard krajicek in straight sets at the u.s. open .
edberg , competing in the 54th consecutive and final grand slam event of his illustrious career , turned back the clock at stadium court with a flowing 6-3 6-3 6-3 serve-and-volley victory over the fifth-seeded dutchman .
" it 's a win that i can be proud of , " said the 30-year-old swede , winner of two u.s. opens and six grand slam titles in all . "
it 's never easy to beat the wimbledon champion . "
edberg , who has said he will retire at season 's end , made it look easy under gray skies at the national tennis centre .
the unseeded swede struck quickly , breaking krajicek in the first game and never let loose his grip on the one hour 44 minute match as he served and volleyed with the grace that made him one of the dominant players of his time .
" there 's not doubt about it , richard was definitely off his game and i took advantage , " said edberg .
" i still have my days where i feel great out there . "
also reaching the second round were top-seeded defending champion pete sampras , a 6-2 6-2 6-1 winner over last minute replacement jimy szymanski of venezuela , called on after adrian voinea of romania withdrew because of a sprained ankle .
third seed thomas muster of austria also charged into the second round with a 6-1 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 6-2 romp over javier frana of argentina .
marcelo rios of chile , the 10th seed , also advanced .
rios claimed a 4-6 6-1 6-4 6-2 victory over romania 's andrei pavel .
on the women 's side , second seed monica seles got off to a strong start by beating fellow-american anne miller 6-0 6-1 and was joined in the second round by spain 's arantxa sanchez vicario ( seeded third ) , olympic champion lindsay davenport ( 8 ) and karina habsudova of slovakia ( 17 ) .
the women 's draw lost another seed when austrian judith wiesner overcame iva majoli of croatia 2-6 6-3 6-1 .
the fifth- seeded majoli joined anke huber ( 5 ) and magdalena maleeva ( 12 ) on the sidelines .

baseball - giants edge phillies 1-0 .
san francisco 1996-08-27
william vanlandingham pitched eight scoreless innings and glenallen hill drove in the game 's only run with a first-inning single as the san francisco giants claimed a 1-0 victory over the philadelphia phillies on monday .
vanlandingham ( 8-13 ) , who entered the game with one complete game in the first 56 starts of his career , limited the phillies to two hits and two walks with four strikeouts .
" we 've been working all year on my follow-through , and i really concentrated on that , " vanlandingham said . "
it gave me more life in all of my pitches , so the ball moved more . "
at colorado , andres galarraga homered and drove in three runs as the colorado rockies had 10 extra-base hits and billy swift won his first game in almost a year in a 9-5 rain-shortened seven-inning victory over the cincinnati reds .
swift ( 1-0 ) , who made his first start since june 3rd and underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder earlier in the season , allowed five runs and six hits in five innings .
in houston , andy benes allowed two runs over seven innings and royce clayton had a run-scoring single in the seventh to lift the st. louis cardinals to a 3-2 victory over the houston astros .
benes ( 14-9 ) allowed five hits , walked five and struck out 10 for his 11th win in 12 decisions .
the cardinals moved within one-half game of first-place houston in the national league central division .
baseball - orioles win , yankees lose .
baltimore 1996-08-27
cal ripken 's bases-loaded walk scored brady anderson with the winning run in the bottom of the 10th as the baltimore orioles regained control of the top spot in the wild-card race with a wild 12-11 victory over the oakland athletics .
trailing by a run entering the 11th , the orioles rallied against oakland reliever mark acre ( 0-2 ) with a walk and a triple by brady anderson to tie the game .
then oakland manager art howe decided to intentionally walk rafael palmeiro and bobby bonilla to load the bases but acre was nowhere near the plate to ripken .
the decisive pitch nearly hit ripken and gave the orioles a one-half game lead over the chicago white sox in the wild-card race .
in seattle , jay buhner 's eighth-inning single snapped a tie as the seattle mariners edged the new york yankees 2-1 in the opener of a three-game series .
new york starter jimmy key left the game in the first inning after seattle shortstop alex rodriguez lined a shot off his left elbow .
the yankees have lost 12 of their last 19 games and their lead in the al east over baltimore fell to five games .
at california , tim wakefield pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game of the season and mo vaughn and troy o'leary hit solo home runs in the second inning as the surging boston red sox won their third straight 4-1 over the california angels .
boston has won seven of eight and is 20-6 since august 2nd .
the red sox are two games over .500 for the first time this season .
in chicago , cal eldred pitched 5-1/3 scoreless innings and john jaha scored one run and doubled in another as the milwaukee brewers held off the slumping chicago white sox , 3-2 .
eldred ( 6-5 ) walked one and struck out three .
angel miranda retired one batter and bob wickman retired the next four but loaded the bases in the eighth .
in detroit , jim thome 's solo homer in the ninth inning snapped a tie and charles nagy pitched a three-hitter for his first win in over a month , leading the cleveland indians to their 11th straight victory over the detroit tigers , 2-1 .
with the score tied 1-1 in the ninth , thome hit a 2-2 pitch from starter felipe lira ( 6-11 ) over the left-field fence for his 29th homer .
in toronto , juan guzman allowed three runs over seven innings to make homers by joe carter and carlos delgado stand up as the surging toronto blue jays held off the minnesota twins , 5-3 .
toronto returned home from a 10-game road trip and won for the eighth time in nine games as guzman ( 11-8 ) allowed nine hits and struck out eight without a walk .

tennis - chang , washington advance , two women 's seeds fall .
larry fine
new york 1996-08-26
michael chang is playing in his 10th u.s. open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old american had to overcome a case of the jitters monday before winning his first-round match on opening day .
chang , seeded second behind defending champion pete sampras , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked jaime oncins of brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker .
" i was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish .
" everyone has moments when they get tight .
hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . "
joining chang into the second round was wimbledon runner-up malivai washington , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented moroccan karim alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 .
washington 's win was not comfortable , either .
the 27-year-old american hurried off the stadium court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against alami .
" towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said washington . "
maybe it was a combination of the heat and something i ate . "
chang and washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall .
australian open runner-up anke huber of germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked south african amanda coetzer in her opening match .
coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to huber in melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory .
last year 's wimbledon junior champion , aleksandra olsza of poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 magdalena maleeva of bulgaria 6-4 6-2 .
other men 's winners included a pair of former grand slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round .
germany 's michael stich , the 1991 wimbledon champion , and two-time french open winner sergi bruguera of spain will face each other next after beating german tommy haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and belgian kris goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively .
alex o'brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in new haven , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over ecuador 's nicolas lapentti .
wimbledon bad boy jeff tarango caught a break monday when he advanced after the retirement of german alex radulescu due to heat exhaustion .
tarango was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 .
chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 barcelona olympics .
chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults .
the most deflating double fault came when oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker .
the set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .
first chang approached the umpire , then oncins , then chang again before play finally resumed .
" those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance .
chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for oncins , the contest was a personal victory .
the 26-year-old brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 .
the next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in sao paulo .
he died slumped against oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis .
" two months ago i started talking about quitting , " said oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the open qualifying tournament last weekend .
" i believe in my game again , " he said .
at the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced .
eighth seed jim courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 open champion mats wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said .
women 's ninth seed mary joe fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .

soccer - marseille hold auxerre to goalless draw .
paris 1996-08-27
former european champions marseille held french champions auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on tuesday .
the bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing .
auxerre , who start their european cup campaign next week against ajax amsterdam , dominated the match but were unable to score .
unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders lens by one point .
lens , who have won all their three league matches so far , host montpellier on wednesday night .
despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to metz last saturday .
after two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of french , marseille are not playing with any fluidity .
but german international goalkeeper andreas koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the auxerre strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries .
marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points .

soccer - neuchatel to appeal against cyprien 's nine-month ban .
geneva 1996-08-27
swiss league leaders neuchatel xamax said on tuesday they would appeal against a nine-month ban imposed on french international defender jean-pierre cyprien for his part in a post-match brawl .
cyprien , also fined 10,000 swiss francs ( $ 8,400 ) , traded punches with st gallen 's brazilian player claudio moura after a match on saturday .
when officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , cyprien launched a flying kick at moura , but only succeeded in kneeing st gallen coach roger hegi in the stomach .
moura , who appeared to have elbowed cyprien in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by neuchatel , was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs ( $ 840 ) by the swiss league disciplinary committee .
club president gilbert facchinetti said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal .
neuchatel coach gilbert gress described the incident as " shocking " , but said moura was also to blame .
" moura physically and verbally provoked cyprien during the match .
the referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him , " gress said .
" during the scuffle , moura threw the first punch .
tomorrow , if someone punches me , i would not know how to react . "
cyprien , who won his one french cap against italy in february 1994 , cannot play in switzerland or elsewhere until may next year .
cycling - bugno cleared of doping .
milan 1996-08-27
veteran italian gianni bugno has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the tour of switzerland in june , the italian cycling federation said on tuesday .
" he has been cleared .
the case is closed , " a spokesman said .
bugno tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the tour , in which he finished third overall .
but the spokesman said subsequent tests in cologne proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally .
bugno , who won the giro d'italia in 1990 and two successive world titles , was banned for three months in 1994 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine .

cofinec slips on budapest bourse but future strong .
emese bartha
budapest 1996-08-27
expectations that cofinec s.a. , the hungarian bourse 's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term .
" the first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 1996 , " said gabor sitanyi , a london-based analyst for ing barings .
the french-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in hungary in july , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints / global depositary receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed .
the company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual august 15 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on tuesday at 5,800 forints , down 300 .
" cofinec 's first-half figures will be ...
between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said tamas erdei , a budapest-based analyst for abn-amro hoare govett .
analysts blame , at least partly , hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for cofinec which , operating in hungary , poland and the czech republic , now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from hungary .
hungary 's gross domestic product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 .
both will have their impact on cofinec 's figures , the analysts said .
despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that cofinec 's outlook was strong .
" the eastern european market offers good chances , " said erdei . "
just like many other companies on the bourse , cofinec has big growth opportunities . "
" at the same time , it 's an advantage for cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " erdei added .
" cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east europe that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " sitanyi said , saying that several recent moves by cofinec boosted its position .
among them , he noted that cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its czech folding company krpaco a.s. , increasing its ownership to 100 percent , so in the second half the whole of krpaco 's figures will be consolidated .
the company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million .
in addition , its polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned .

new york 1996-08-27

worldcom , which said it will buy mfs , shed 1-3/4 to close at 21 while mfs lost 3-8/16 to close at 41-5/16 .
the new york stock exchange said its session one volume was 5,700 shares compared to 53,400 shares monday .

cboe in routine review of mfs options .
chicago 1996-08-27
the chicago board options exchange ( cboe ) said on tuesday it was doing a routine investigation into trading in options on mfs communications co inc shares .
on monday , the company said it had agreed to be acquired by worldcom inc in a deal valued at $ 14 billion .
mfs shares surged on the news while worldcom fell on fears of dilution .
the new york times said on tuesday some of the options trading in mfs last friday may suggest insider trading .
mfs options also trade on the american stock exchange and the pacific stock exchange .
a spokesman for the american stock exchange would neither confirm or deny whether the exchange was looking into trading .
" if there is unusual activity , certainly we look at it , but that 's not to say we 're doing anything official , " he said .
pacific stock exchange officials were not available .
one trader said trading in mfs options had increased steadily from about mid-august , and doubted whether any of last friday 's activity was insider trading .

elizabeth , n.j. 1996-08-27
faulding inc said on tuesday purdue frederick co filed a patent infringement lawsuit against faulding and its purepac pharamceutical unit .

mcgrath left out of ireland world cup squad .
dublin 1996-08-27
ireland 's most experienced player , defender paul mcgrath , was left out of the national squad for the first time in 11 years on tuesday when new manager mick mccarthy named his side to face liechtenstein in a world cup qualifier .
the 36-year-old aston villa player won the last of his irish record of 82 international caps against the czech republic in prague in april .
" paul accepted the situation .
he has n't played any first-team games for villa this season and he 's not the type of player i would have brought on as a substitute , " mccarthy said . "
but he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement .
he 's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future .
" at 24 , 25 or 26 you could get away with it , not having played first-team games .
but at 36 it would be asking too much of paul , " he said .
also omitted from the 20-man squad which will travel to vaduz for saturday 's group eight match are central defenders alan kernaghan and liam daish .
leeds united defender gary kelly is unable to travel because of a knee injury picked up in monday 's 1-0 victory over wimbledon at elland road .
since taking over from jack charlton in february , mccarthy has played largely experimental sides and seen them lose five times , draw twice and win just once .
squad : alan kelly , shay given , denis irwin , phil babb , jeff kenna , curtis fleming , gary breen , ian harte , kenny cunningham , steve staunton , andy townsend , ray houghton , gareth farrelly , alan mcloughlin , jason mcateer , alan moore , keith o'neill , tony cascarino , niall quinn , david kelly .

s. african apartheid killer convicted of six murders .
pretoria 1996-08-27
south african apartheid killer eugene de kock was found guilty of murder and attempted murder on tuesday , a day after he was convicted of five other murders .
de kock , 48 , a former police colonel who commanded a hit-squad that wiped out opponents of apartheid , is the most senior servant of white rule yet to face justice .
sudanese rebels say missionaries should be freed .
peter smerdon
nairobi 1996-08-27
the main rebel group in south sudan said on tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six roman catholic missionaries , including three australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks .
george garang , nairobi spokesman for the sudan people 's liberation army ( spla ) , said it was urgently trying to contact spla commander nuour marial at mapourdit in the south to free the six .
" the movement is making arrangements for them to be set free .
this is a decision of the leadership , " garang said .
" commander nuour marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision .
but communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added .
the catholic information office in nairobi said on monday that four of the six had been charged by the spla with spying , spreading islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group .
" these charges are the interpretation of the church , " garang said on tuesday . "
we have no idea why they are being held .
we are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . "
asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem .
he said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at mapourdit and were reported to be in good health .
the catholic information office in nairobi said on monday that australian sisters moira lynch , 73 , and mary batchelor , 68 , american father michael barton , 48 , and sudanese father raphael riel , 48 , were held in a prison in south sudan by the spla .
it said australian sister maureen carey , 52 , and italian brother raniero iacomella , 28 , were held inside the compound .
the church in australia said on monday lynch , batchelor , barton and riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound .
the catholic information office said the spla in the kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by august 23 .
but the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed .
it said last friday they were visited by monsignor caesar mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of rumbek in southern sudan , and an spla administrator and appeared in good condition .
" on august 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the spla ) and sealed off .
the evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation .
later the mission was looted , " it added .
an australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern .
he said australian diplomats in nairobi were working with the roman catholic church in southern sudan and with u.s. and italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries .
the spla has fought khartoum 's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly christian and animist region from the moslem , arabised north .
osce postpones bosnian municipal elections .
sarajevo 1996-08-27
the u.s. diplomat in charge of elections in bosnia announced on tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the serbs in registering voters .
ambassador robert frowick , representing the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on september 14 with other bosnian elections would be put off .
" i have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on september 14 , " said frowick .
he said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 .
according to osce officials , serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under serb control , but which used to have moslem majorities .
human rights workers say authorities in serbia and bosnian serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the dayton peace agreement .
diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war .
the response of the bosnian serbs to the osce 's announcement was not immediately clear .
but bosnian serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own .
the bosnian serb cabinet , in a letter to the osce , said on monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the dayton agreement " .
the serbs , who administer half of bosnia in a serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the september elections .
diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the dayton peace agreement had planned .
new talks in chechnya as lebed waits for yeltsin .
dmitry kuznets
novye atagi , russia 1996-08-27
russian and rebel military commanders finally met in chechnya on tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by president boris yeltsin 's envoy alexander lebed .
the russian army commander in the region , general vyacheslav tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of novye atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the chechen capital grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff aslan maskhadov .
but lebed himself , the kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in moscow to meet yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in chechnya .
itar-tass news agency quoted the kremlin press service as saying yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near moscow on monday , would hold no working meetings on tuesday .
lebed interrupted talks with chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on sunday , saying he had to consult with yeltsin .
after a meeting failed to materialise on monday , lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on tuesday .
but yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left moscow for a holiday near the capital .
the russians postponed the talks after a chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on sunday .
the chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on monday they had all been returned .
the russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken .
tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by lebed and maskhadov last thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks .
neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 gmt ) .
also in novye atagi on tuesday morning , was tim guldimann , the swiss diplomat who heads the chechnya mission of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) .
guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in may , was not taking part in the tikhomirov-maskhadov talks .
lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict .
however , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained .
three russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , itar-tass news agency quoted the russian military as saying on tuesday morning .
ria news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint russian-chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital grozny on tuesday .
but the separatist command told interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by lebed last week , would begin on tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " .
yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated lebed was low on the list by saying yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him .
russian news agencies also quoted the kremlin spokesman as saying that lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol .
yeltsin , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in july , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state .
aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign .
some analysts say the kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into chechnya in 1994 started russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart .
but lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from yeltsin .
his proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and moscow 's insistence that chechnya remain part of the russian federation .
slovenia and poland target eu , nato membership .
ljubljana 1996-08-27
slovenia and poland pledged to intensify cooperation on tuesday and reinforced their determination to join the european union and nato at the earliest possible date .
polish president aleksander kwasniewski and his slovenian counterpart , milan kucan , met for talks at the start of a two-day visit to slovenia by kwasniewski .
it was their fourth meeting this year .
they said in a statement they agreed to have regular telephone contact to discuss progress in strengthening ties with the west .
" we expect our cooperation will help both countries towards entering the european union and nato , " kwasniewski said .
" we have similar ambitions as far as our internal development and international life is concerned , " kucan said .
poland and slovenia are hoping to be among the first group of former eastern bloc countries to join the european union and nato .
they have already signed an association agreement with the european union and are both part of the central european free trade area , which also comprises hungary , slovakia and the czech republic .
slovenia 's trade with poland rose to $ 142.3 million in 1995 from $ 118.8 million in 1994 .
during his visit to slovenia , kwasniewski is also scheduled to meet prime minister janez drnovsek , representatives of slovenian political parties and representatives of the chamber of economy .
nationalists want iliescu ousted for hungary pact .
bucharest 1996-08-27
junior nationalist members of romania 's ruling coalition called on tuesday for the impeachment of president ion iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring hungary .
iliescu 's party of social democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the national unity party ( punr ) demand as crude electioneering .
" it is a desperate move by the punr , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said pdsr executive president adrian nastase .
" this treaty is both necessary and good , " nastase said , adding that the punr 's stance was threatening its position in the government .
the treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of romania 's large ethnic hungarian minority .
it will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to nato and the european union .
" if they ( the punr ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ...
we might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said .
the punr holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications .
punr leader gheorghe funar said in a statement iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month .
funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of iliescu 's campaign for a new term at november 3 polls .
his appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said .
iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both romanian and hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons .
presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for iliescu 's impeachment .
estonian mps see little hope of electing president .

tallinn 1996-08-27
estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent lennart meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state .
neither meri , who oversaw estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the soviet union , nor his arch-rival , former communist arnold ruutel , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament .
meri garnered 49 votes and meri 34 in tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of estonia .
a third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result .
if there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college .
" the votes are a strong message to meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , " reform party head heiki kranich told reuters .
under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers .
his only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis .
but meri , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions .
his relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense .
his support in the first round of voting on monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance .
this support only inched up to 49 in the second vote .
support for ruutel , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes .
if the third vote fails to give either meri or ruutel 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 mps and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations .
this would be the first time that the former soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college .
in its first presidential election in 1992 meri won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against ruutel .
parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .
estonia assembly fails to elect state president .
tallinn 1996-08-27
the estonian parliament failed for a third and final time to elect a new state president on tuesday , refusing a second mandate for incumbent lennart meri .
neither meri nor his rival arnold ruutel could garner the 68 votes needed from the 101 members of parliament to become president .
in the third vote meri won 52 and ruutel won 32 votes .
the final decision will now be made by a larger assembly .
meri won 49 in a second vote earlier on tuesday and 45 in the first on monday .
ruutel won 34 votes in the first two secret ballots .
enn markvart , chairman of the national election commission said 96 members of parliament cast votes , with one ballot paper invalid and 11 abstentions .
the election will now go before an electoral college involving mps and local government representatives that will be convened by the parliamentary speaker in the next day or so .
it could take up to a month before a new vote but the timetable is not yet clear .
this is the first time the former soviet republic has had to convene such a group .
albania charges briton with child sex abuse .
tirana 1996-08-27
albanian authorities have arrested and charged a british man for sexually abusing two young boys , a tirana prosecutor said on tuesday .
" we have arrested him and charged him with these shameful acts of sex abuse of little children , " prosecutor adnan xhelili told reuters .
xhelili said paul thompson , 34 , from wiltshire , was arrested on sunday in a hotel in the adriatic resort of durres , 45 km ( 30 miles ) west of tirana .
thompson has denied the charges .
he could face up to five years in jail if convicted .
xhelili said thompson , who is divorced , said he befriended the boys , both aged under 10 , because they reminded him of his own children who live with his former wife in london .
the prosecutor 's office said no date had yet been set for a trial to begin as investigations had first to be completed .
the british embassy in tirana said it had sent an embassy official to talk to thompson who is being held in jail .
the age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual sex in albania is 14 .
a large number of destitute children can be seen begging in the streets of impoverished albania , especially in towns and resorts visited by foreigners .
estonia assembly again fails to elect president .
tallinn 1996-08-27
estonia 's parliament again failed to elect a new state president on tuesday when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting .
incumbent president lennart meri won 49 votes compared to 34 won by his rival , deputy parliamentary speaker arnold ruutel .
but meri 's support was not enough for the 68 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day ( 1300 gmt ) , parliamentary officials said .
to win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament .
enn markvart , chairman of the national election commission , said 96 members of parliament voted in the second round , with 12 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid .
on monday , in the first round of voting , meri secured 45 votes and ruutel 34 .
meri 's popularity has suffered in recent years , with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament .
if a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 mps and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month .
slovak women visited dutroux , police say .

bratislava 1996-08-27
marc dutroux , the chief accused in belgium 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case , visited slovakia a number of times and about 10 young slovak women went to belgium at his invitation , police said on tuesday .
but they have difficulty remembering what happened there , perhaps because of drugs , and are unsure whether they were filmed for pornography , rudolf gajdos , head of the slovak office of interpol , told reuters .
although gajdos spoke of " girls " his deputy , eva boudova , said the case involved about 10 young women in their early 20s .
" the police interrogated several slovak girls who said that they had been invited by mark dutroux to visit belgium , " gajdos said .
" the girls said they went to belgium voluntarily and the police suspect that they were used to act in pornographic films . "
" the police suspect ( the girls ) were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills . "
" we have suspicions of a rape , but the police still have to find the victim , " gajdos added .
dutroux 's last visit to slovakia was reported to have been as recent as july .
slovak police are also cooperating with belgium in the search for an marchal and eefje lambrecks , who went missing last august .
dutroux , 39 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two other girls aged 14 and 12 , is one of several suspects in the marchal and lambrecks case .
last saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls , aged eight , who died of starvation this year after their abduction in june , 1995 .
the czech office of interpol said on friday it would neither confirm nor deny that dutroux had been in the czech republic , slovakia 's western neighbour and former federation partner .
belgian police said an officer had visited bratislava to talk with slovak detectives about an and eefje and other disappearances , and he planned to go also to prague .

russian police in the urals city of perm are on the trail of a serial killer who has claimed his seventh victim in just a few months , itar-tass news agency said on tuesday .

russian army , chechens open new round of talks .
moscow 1996-08-27
russia 's military commander in chechnya began new talks with separatist chief-of-staff aslan maskhadov on tuesday , itar-tass news agency said .
tass said the talks were taking place in the settlement of novye atagi , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the chechen capital grozny .
the talks had been postponed while the russians waited for the rebels to return arms and ammunition seized from russian soldiers at the weekend .
the chechens said on monday they had returned all the weapons , which they said were seized by a renegade group .
the talks between maskhadov and russia 's vyacheslav tikhomirov are aimed at putting the finishing touches to a ceasefire sealed last week in talks with russian security chief alexander lebed .
lebed , who met russian prime minister viktor chernomyrdin on monday to discuss the progress he made on a political settlement for the breakaway region , has been seeking a meeting with president boris yeltsin , who started a holiday near moscow on monday .
argentine bishop reminds cabinet of commandments .
buenos aires , argentina 1996-08-27
the archbishop of buenos aires said on tuesday the first thing he would do if elected president of argentina would be to put up posters of the ten commandments in government offices .
" they asked me what would be the first thing i would do if i were president , and i said the first thing i would do would be to resign straight away , " archbishop antonio quarracino said at a sermon attended by several cabinet ministers .
" but before going , i would have big signs put up in all government offices , those to do with justice , in all sectors , with the ten commandments , " he added .
argentina 's top roman catholic cleric said the biblical commandment " thou shalt not steal " would get special emphasis " because it has to be about the most common thing these days . "
quarracino and other church leaders are regular critics of the government 's free-market economic policy .

dutch government wo n't pay ransom for kidnap victims .
san jose , costa rica 1996-08-27
the netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a dutch couple kidnapped from their farm , while costa rican authorities said on tuesday they had no leads in the case .
" we have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , " chief of judicial police manuel alvarado told reuters .
hurte sierd zylstra and his wife , jetsi hendrika coers , both 50 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late saturday or early sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said .
costa rican officials on monday had given different names for the couple .
anton schutte , an official with the embassy for belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg , said the dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . "
we 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , " schutte added .
a note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , schutte told a news conference on monday .
he said the note , believed to have been hand-written in spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to ebe huizinga , another dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . "
depending on you , we will either live or die , " it said .
alvarado said the car was abandoned about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring nicaragua .
the farm is in the border region where a german tourist and a swiss tour guide were kidnapped last new year 's eve by a heavily armed band led by a former nicaraguan guerrilla .
the two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom .
two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested .
venezuela unions harden towards cvg privatization .
caracas 1996-08-27
a swell of protest is growing within venezuela 's trade unions at the proposed year-end privatization of the state-owned holding company corporacion venezolana de guayana ( cvg ) , cvg union leaders said tuesday .
" we oppose the way the government is proceeding with the sale , " ramon machuca , sidor trade union secretary general and member of union-based opposition party radical cause , told reporters .
" we do n't believe the government will make its timetable , " he added .
sidor is the cvg 's steel-producing arm , slated for a december sale worth an estimated $ 1.5 billion .
the cvg 's aluminum companies venalum and alucasa are also scheduled to be sold early 1997 .
arguing that cvg 's privatization would result in some 13,000 layoffs , compared to the government 's estimated 1,500 , cvg 's union leaders told reporters they would strike and stage protests if their concerns were not addressed .
" we oppose any privatization that hurts workers ' welfare and does not take into account its social impact , " they said .
the opposition party radical cause controls all of the unionized workers at the cvg heavy industry complex and has systematically opposed all government legislation in congress .

nicaraguan drunks fear " lovebite " bandit .
managua , nicaragua 1996-08-27
heavy drinkers in a nicaraguan city were searching for someone who has covered them in " lovebites " while they were passed out in a drunken stupor , a local newspaper reported on tuesday .
the dreaded " chupabolos " -- " drunksucker " -- preys on men who have passed out in the streets of matagalpa , 80 miles ( 130 kms ) north of managua , placing hickey-like " lovebites " on various parts of their bodies , el nuevo diario reported .
enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market .
the total number of victims was still unknown .
the first of the victims were two vagrants who slept in an abandoned car in front of a local bank , the newspaper said .
in spite of the collective fear gripping matagalpa 's drinkers , local women expressed little sympathy .
" its just desserts for all the ' bolos ' ( drunkards ) who sleep in the streets of our beautiful town , " said a woman who worked in the local market .
brazil likely to turn banespa federal bank - paper .
sao paulo 1996-08-27
brazil is likely to turn sao paulo state bank banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , o globo daily said .
the newspaper said the central bank special administration of banespa ends in december 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return banespa to sao paulo state government .
a central bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report .
banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since december 1994 .
the central bank management could be lifted if sao paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks .
under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks .
it also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks .
although the plan was designed under terms proposed by sao paulo state governor mario covas , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because sao paulo 's debt with banespa has increased sharply , o globo said .
sao paulo state 's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais .
o globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank bamerindus .
the newspaper said bamerindus has sent to the central bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the basic interest rate of the central bank ( tbc ) .
o globo also said the loan would give bamerindus time to sell assets .
bamerindus , brazil 's fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles .
bamerindus declined to comment on negotiations being held with the central bank .

former argentine benevolent dictator alejandro lanusse dies .
buenos aires 1996-08-26
alejandro lanusse , the former dictator who ruled argentina for two years , died at age 78 on monday .
lanusse died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain .
he was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery .
the former dictator , who ruled from 1971 to 1973 , was best known for allowing juan domingo peron , argentina 's famed populist leader , to return to argentina after 17 years of forced exile .
lanusse took over the leadership of the country after five years of dictatorship .
but unlike his two predecessors , juan carlos ongania and marcelo levingston , who ruled argentina with an iron hand , lanusse steered the country toward democracy .
that resulted in general elections in march 1973 when the peronists led by hector campora and vicente solano lima returned to power .
lanusse was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office .
he was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow peron led by general benjamin menendez .
lanusse 's rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal argentine dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 , during which the military launched its " dirty war " that resulted in 10,000 missing people .
in his autobiography published in 1990 , lanusse described himself as a military man with " democratic ideas . "
he was born in buenos aires in 1918 and married ileana bell with whom he had nine children .
he entered the military college in 1935 .

a blind 10-year-old boy from china sneaked over the border into hong kong and was arrested as an illegal immigrant , hong kong police said on tuesday .
he was caught by police trying to force his way into a home in the rural new territories , a police spokesman said .
" the boy came from china 's eastern province of jiangsu .
he was spotted by a passerby trying to climb into an apartment in the early hours of monday morning , " the spokesman said .
no decision has yet been made on how to deal with the boy .
hong kong police regularly catch hundreds of illegal immigrants and people who have overstayed their visas from mainland china and send them back .

new u.n. relief coordinator arrives in iraq .

baghdad 1996-08-27
a new u.n. relief coordinator has arrived in baghdad to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face iraq 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved .
u.n. and diplomatic sources said on tuesday that secretary- general boutros boutros-ghali had appointed italian gualtiero fulcheri and sent him to iraq last week to replace moroccan mohamed zejjari .
one diplomat said iraq and u.n. were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under baghdad 's oil deal with u.n .
" the united nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors .
baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat .
baghdad holds that the iraq-u.n. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last june does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in iraq .
" observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat .
iraq 's partial oil sales pact with u.n. , allowing crude exports worth $ 2 billion every six months , gives u.n. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country .
the deal is a humanitarian exception to the u.n. sanctions imposed on iraq for invading kuwait in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports .
fulcheri declined comment on the differences between the u.n. and iraq , saying only : " there are several different things which still need to be done . "
fulcheri started his u.n. career in 1960 and has long experience in u.n. emergency relief in congo , angola , sudan and somalia .

anti-abortion speaker praises democrat tolerance .

chicago 1996-08-27
an anti-abortion politician addressed the democratic convention on tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views .
rep .
tony hall of ohio said he and other democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party .
" but this year is different .
for the first time , the democratic party has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said .
the clause recognizes and welcomes democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party .
" the democratic party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " hall said .
at its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then pennsylvania gov .
robert casey , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking .
republicans have used their decision as an example of democrat intolerance ever since .
casey told a news conference in chicago on tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down .
democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak .
" i believe the democratic party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " casey said .
" i asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the democrat national convention .
for the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said .
the republican party , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when massachusetts gov .
william weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down .
bob dole , the republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights .
democrats also heard tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights .
kate michelman , president of the national abortion rights action league , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children .
" i 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth .
the message from the republican party is one of disdain .
their answer to choice is control and punishment .
our answer is trust , compassion and respect , " she said .

poll shows clinton lead over dole jumps to 15 pts .
chicago 1996-08-27
an abc news poll released on tuesday showed president bill clinton 's lead over republican challenger bob dole stretching to 15 points in advance of the nov. 5 election .
the poll , taken on sunday and monday as the president engaged in a whistle-stop train trip to the democratic convention in chicago , put clinton at 51 percent , dole at 36 percent and ross perot of the reform party at 8 percent .
a similar poll conducted on saturday and sunday had showed a nine point lead for clinton , ahead by 47-38 percent .
dole , down by around 20 points in early august in abc polls , had closed to within four percentage points immediately after the republican convention in san diego earlier in august .
other polls also showed a strong dole bounce after san diego but clinton then rebuilding his lead .
tuesday 's poll involved 1,002 registered voters and had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points .
abc said a parallel poll of 824 likely voters showed the president ahead by 11 points , with clinton at 50 percent , dole at 39 percent and perot at 6 percent .
the poll of registered voters showed a shift in favor of the democrats in the elections for house of representatives , with 51 percent saying that if the vote were today they would go for a democrat and 41 percent opting for a republican .
that compared with the previous poll 's 48-43 lead for the democrats .
the poll gave clinton a 53 percent to 39 percent lead over dole if perot were not in the race .
the poll indicated a fall in the number of people who believed dole would be able to fulfil his promise to cut the federal budget deficit and cut income taxes by 15 percent at the same time .
it showed 23 percent believed it possible compared to 70 who believed it was n't .
that compared to 26-57 in the previous poll .

puerto rico girl has surgery for hairy face .
philadelphia 1996-08-27
a two-year old puerto rican girl began surgical treatment on tuesday for a rare condition that has left half of her face covered with a hairy , dark-brown patch of skin .
the girl , abyss dejesus , suffers from a " hairy nevus " on the right side of her face , a condition that has only been reported a few times in medical journals , the st. christopher children 's hospital said .
in addition to social ostracism , the condition also carries a high risk of cancer .
it will be corrected by gradually expanding healthy skin with a surgical balloon , then transplanting that skin to the afflicted side of her face .
" she is doing well , " hospital spokeswoman carol norris said . "
the surgery is under way . "

mother teresa turns 86 but still in danger .
rupam banerjee
calcutta 1996-08-27
mother teresa spent her 86th birthday in a calcutta hospital bed on tuesday as tributes to the legendary missionary poured in from around the world .
doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the nobel peace prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days .
" her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , " an official at woodlands nursing home said . "
she is conscious but her breathing is irregular . "
the revered roman catholic nun was admitted to the calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting .
she later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria .
her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said .
" unless she breathes on her own , i would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , " said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating mother teresa .
the nun 's birthday prompted greetings , bouquets and prayers from around the world .
pope john paul ii and israeli foreign minister david levy sent her get-well messages , the press trust of india said .
" ask for a miracle .
happy birthday to our dearest mother , " read a placard at the shishu bhavan children 's home in central calcutta run by mother teresa 's missionaries of charity .
on monday , both houses of india 's parliament wished the nation 's adopted sister a happy birthday and speedy recovery from her illness .
prayers continued in calcutta , one of the world 's poorest cities , where mother teresa 's missionaries of charity runs several homes for the poor and destitute .
street children , some of them born to prostitutes , held prayers on the street . "
all of us know about her .
she is like a goddess , " said raju , 8 , who has a mother but no father .
the statesman newspaper quoted 40-year-old mangala das , paralysed from her waist down and a resident of the prem dan ( gift of love ) home for the destitute , as saying she and her friends had been praying incessantly for mother teresa 's recovery .
tarak das , 70 , was picked up from a calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to nirmal hriday ( immaculate home ) .
" i do not know who she is .
i have never seen her , but i can only bless her for what she has done for people like me , " das told the statesman .
mother teresa 's condition improved on sunday as her fever abated , and on monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns .
thousands in calcutta , where she founded her missionaries of charity religious order in 1949 , prayed for her recovery .
ministers of the communist government of west bengal state and people of different religions joined catholics to pray for mother teresa 's recovery at mother house .
" we joined the prayer to express our solidarity with her work for the cause of the poor and downtrodden , " said nanda gopal bhattacharya , a communist minister in west bengal .
islamists can meet in london , minister .
islamabad 1996-08-27
british foreign secretary malcolm rifkind said on tuesday that his government would only take action against a planned conference of islamist groups in london if british law was broken .
" people who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in britain , " rifkind , in pakistan for a visit , told reuters . "
as long as they obey our laws then that is not something the government would normally interfere with . "
the islamist conference , due to be held in london on september 8 , has caused concern in countries such as algeria and egypt , which are fighting armed islamic militants .
british jewish groups have also protested because they say members of algeria 's islamic salvation front ( fis ) and the palestinian islamic group hamas are on the guest list .
rifkind said it was for the home secretary ( interior minister ) to act by denying visas to participants if he felt there was reason to believe that they might break the law .
" our policy has to be fundamentally based on respect for the rule of law and insistence that it be observed , " he said .
rifkind was in pakistan at the start of an asian tour that will also take him to india , sri lanka , japan and mongolia .
afghan leader tells u.s. congressman of peace plan .
sayed salahuddin
kabul 1996-08-27
afghan government military chief ahmad shah masood briefed visiting u.s. congressman dana rohrabacher on tuesday on a peace plan for his wartorn country .
a spokesman for masood said he had told the california republican at a meeting in northern kabul that president burhanuddin rabbani 's government favoured talks with all afghan factions to set up an interim government .
the factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader , draft a new constitution , collect heavy weapons , create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing , he added .
rohrabacher flew into bagram military airbase north of kabul in a red cross plane on tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader general abdul rashid dostum .
masood 's spokesman amrollah ( one name ) said rohrabacher had recently visited italy , saudi arabia and pakistan as part of a mission to promote peace in afghanistan .
" we are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the afghan problem and support every u.n. plan , " amrollah quoted rohrabacher as saying .
however , a spokesman for prime minister gulbuddin hekmatyar , a long-time rival of masood , expressed concern at signs of renewed u.s. interest in afghanistan .
" america wants to block the establishment of a strong islamic government in afghanistan and the u.s. intends to neutralise the afghan peace process initiated by the afghans themselves , " said the spokesman , hamid ibrahimi .
" a great game has been started in afghanistan as america feels that tehran and moscow have got stronger in the afghan picture -- something washington wants to change , " he said .
rohrabacher was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of jalalabad and meet leaders of the rebel islamic taleban militia in the southern city of kandahar .
afghan guerrilla factions have been locked in a bloody power struggle since the fall of the communist government in april 1992 .
hekmatyar , once rabbani 's main rival , made a peace pact with him and rejoined the government as prime minister in june .

nepal 's centre-right coalition government has offered to meet the country 's hardline maoist communists for talks in a bid to end an insurgency in nepal 's western districts , officials said on tuesday .
the maoists oppose multi-party democracy and want to establish a communist state .
but the nepali government said the insurgents must give up violence before it negotiates with them .
" they ( the insurgents ) should first give up their violent activities , " home ( interior ) minister khum bahadur khadga said .
about 54 people have died in maoist insurgent activity and in police action against them since february , officials said .
nepali opposition parties have accused the police of having killed more people than the insurgents .
some human rights groups have criticised the government 's handling of the situation .
in a speech in parliament on tuesday , khadga challenged the maoist communists to " win the people 's confidence " and win election to parliament .
on monday , he had offered to talk to leaders of the united people 's front nepal ( bhattarai ) , the maoist faction which leads the insurgency .
" the government is ready to guarantee security of the maoist representatives who want to take part in peaceful dialogue , " khadga said .
a multi-party democracy was set up in nepal six years ago , after a popular movement by the centrist nepali congress party jointly with the communist united marxist-leninist ( uml ) party .
the nepali congress leads the three-party coalition government while the uml is the main opposition party .

bangladesh speaker says he received death threats .
dhaka 1996-08-27
the speaker of bangladesh 's parliament , humayun rasheed choudhury , said he had received death threats from anonymous callers after opposition parties threatened to boycott proceedings chaired by him .
he told the bengali newspaper banglabazar patrika on tuesday that such threats were possibly coming from " those who want to push the country into chaos and unrest . "
the callers said his life could be cut short , the newspaper said .
the speaker was not immediately available for comment .
choudhury , a former foreign minister and veteran diplomat , was appointed speaker of the 330-member parliament on july 13 , a month after general elections returned the awami league of prime minister sheikh hasina to power after 21 years .
choudhury also was president of the 41st session of the u.n. general assembly in 1986-87 .
former prime minister begum khaleda zia , now the opposition leader in parliament and head of the bangladesh nationalist party ( bnp ) , said her followers might boycott assemby sessions chaired by the " partisan " speaker .
" the ruling awami league is making parliament ineffective and the speaker is contributing to that by not allowing the opposition mps enough time to speak , " she told a rally in northern district of bogra on monday .
hasina , speaking to a group of engineers in dhaka on monday , accused the bnp of resorting to " terrorism " as part of its plan to create instability and chaos in the country .
" this is not desireable ...
and we will deal with such designs sternly , " the prime minister said .

barrick gets 93 pct of arequipa .
toronto 1996-08-27
barrick gold corp said on tuesday its takeover offer for arequipa resources ltd was successful , with 93 percent of the 36.3 million shares not already owned tendered under the bid , which expired overnight .
" we are pleased that arequipa shareholders ahave chosen so overwhelmingly to accept this offer .
we now have the opportunity to realize the potential of arequipa 's excellent assets , " barrick chairman and chief executive peter munk said in a statement .
the c$ 30-a-share deal means barrick will own arequipa 's attractive pierina gold deposit in peru .
barrick said details involving the allocation between barrick shares and cash will be available shortly .
barrick 's offer of c$ 30 a share or part cash , part share offer was barrick 's second attempt to swallow the small vancouver-based gold prospector .
toronto-based barrick , the world 's third largest gold producer , sweetened its july 11 bid to c$ 30 a share from c$ 27 on august 16 after a fresh batch of drill results from the pierina deposit .
experts have speculated the deposit has potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces .
more drilling results are expected soon .
the barrick bid took observers by surprise , since arequipa 's exploration was still in its early stages .
arequipa shareholders had the option to choose c$ 30 cash or 0.79 barrick shares plus 50 cents for each arequipa share .
shares were to be pro-rated if more than 14.4 million were requested .

egypt confiscates paper for " mad rulers " article .
cairo 1996-08-27
egypt has banned and confiscated 10,000 copies of the cyprus-based arabic monthly newspaper al-tadamun because of an editorial suggesting mental health tests for arab leaders , the editor-in-chief said on tuesday .
mohamed abu liwaya , said information ministry censors had told him to send all the copies of the august edition back to cyprus at his own expense .
he told reuters the reason was his own front-page editorial , entitled " a chronic mental illness " in which he attacks compliant arab leaders for serving u.s. and israeli interests .
" the arabs demand that our arab leaders undergo a compulsory examination by a team of psychiatrists to see how sound their mental capacities are , " the editorial said .
" because our leaders have started to behave with extreme hostility towards the interests of their peoples to court the goodwill of the americans and the zionists , " he added .
the censorship office denied they had confiscated the newspapers but declined to say when they could go on sale .

wife of gun victim brady praises clinton .
chicago 1996-08-26
sarah brady , whose republican husband was severely disabled in an assassination attempt on president ronald reagan , took centre stage at the democratic national convention on monday night to praise president bill clinton 's gun control efforts .
with her husband james sitting in a wheelchair to the side of the podium , mrs. brady called the handgun control bill that a democratic congress passed and clinton signed in 1994 a major step in controlling firearm violence in the united states .
but she said more had to be done .
the bradys walked on to the stage , he on her arm and with the aid of a cane , to a rousing reception from the convention .
their teenaged son sat in a vip box with first lady hillary rodham clinton and watched as his father returned to his wheelchair .
" jim , we must have made a wrong turn .
this is n't san diego ( site of the republican convention ) , " mrs. brady joked to her husband , who was serving as reagan 's press secretary when he was shot .
" sarah , i told you this is the democratic convention , " he responded to his wife , who before the shooting had worked for two republican congressmen and the republican national party .
" since the brady law went into effect on february 28 , 1994 ( it ) has stopped more than 100,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun .
today , and every day , the brady law is stopping an estimated 85 felons from buying a handgun , " mrs. brady said .
she added , " but we need to do more .
we should , as president clinton proposed today , stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun .
jim and i join with you tonight in saluting the great job that president clinton has done in fighting crime and gun violence . "
" he 's a hunter and a sportsman , but he understands the difference between a remington rifle and an ak47 .
and he knows that you do n't go hunting with an uzi .
mr. president you deserve our thanks . "
jim brady then gave a big thumbs to the audience .
brady
was shot in the head in 1981 by gunman john hinckley , who tried to kill reagan in a deranged bid to impress jodie foster , an actress he never met but with whom he was obsessed .
the brady bill , calling for a waiting period before someone could buy a gun so a background check could be made , was first introduced in congress in 1987 but it took seven years to pass because of opposition from the national rifle association gun lobby .

most hostages freed from hijacked sudanese plane .
stansted , england 1996-08-27
armed hijackers believed to be iraqis released 140 people on tuesday from a sudan airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in london after being diverted on a flight from khartoum to amman , police said .
police spokesman roger grimwade said the six or seven hijackers remained on board the aircraft , which arrived from cyprus at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 gmt ) .
he said they had made various requests to police negotiators but stepped back from earlier suggestions that the hijackers had asked to speak to a british-based iraqi police named as mr sadiki .
the hijackers , who have said they want to seek asylum in britain , are believed to be armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , according to police .
they earlier threatened to blow up the aircraft .
the airbus a310 was diverted first to cyprus , then to britain .

hijacked sudan plane lands at a london airport .
stansted , england 1996-08-27
a hijacked sudan airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew landed at stansted airport just outside london early on tuesday morning after flying from cyprus , eyewitnesses said .
the airbus 310 flight 150 , which was hijacked on monday evening on its way from khartoum to the jordanian capital amman , landed at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 gmt ) after a flight of more than four hours .
at least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and tnt and threatened to blow the plane up in cyprus unless it was refuelled so they could fly to britain to claim political asylum .
" they will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman glafcos xenos told reporters at cyprus 's larnaca airport .
security was tight at stansted airport , which is about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of the capital .
stansted has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern england because it is more remote than heathrow and gatwick , london 's two major airports , and handles less air traffic .
hijacked sudan plane expected at london 's stansted .
london 1996-08-27
a hijacked sudan airways plane with 199 passengers and crew on board was expected to land at london 's stansted airport later on tuesday morning , a police spokeswoman said .
" that is the plan at the moment .
that is where the plane is being directed to , " ruth collin of essex police , the force responsible for stansted , said .
stansted , london 's third-busiest airport after heathrow and gatwick , is located about 30 miles ( 48 km ) northeast of the capital .
british officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at stansted because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at heathrow or gatwick .
they said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking .
the armed hijackers of the airbus 310 flight 150 , which is expected to arrive about 4 a.m. ( 0300 gmt ) , have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in britain .
the plane was hijacked on its way from khartoum to the jordanian capital amman on monday evening and landed at larnaca airport in cyprus to refuel .
the identity and number of the hijackers was not known .
one of them negotiated through the pilot in english .
the pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane .
painted parrot scam lands australian in jail .
perth , australia 1996-08-27
a conman who painted common australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on tuesday .
denham peiris painted six green parrots , worth about a$ 100 ( us$ 79 ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as indian ringneck parrots , valued at a$ 14,000 a pair .
peiris , 32 , of perth , was sentenced in the western australian district court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 21 parrots worth a total of a$ 28,000 .
" everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner shane drew , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds .
" i 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they 're nice birds , " drew told reporters outside court .
" after i was told they were dyed , i checked them over again .
it was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " drew said .
drew said peiris , a bird enthusiast , would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam .
if not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said .
" they moult in the summer , so five or six months down the track , i would have looked like the guilty party , " drew said .

seoul embassies warned of terrorist attacks .
seoul 1996-08-27
south korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former yugoslavia received a threat over seoul 's crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on tuesday .
a letter to the belgrade embassy on monday under the name of the macedonian communist party demanded south korea release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said .
" the letter said the party would assault the embassy , other south korean-related facilities and korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , " he said .
nearly 400 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist north korea were crushed by riot police at a seoul university this month .
authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror .
" the ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , " the official said , asking not to be named .
it had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in canada and bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown .
nuclear pact will be a step to disarmament-china .
beijing 1996-08-27
china on tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by india last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament .
" although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official people 's daily newspaper said in a commentary .
india blocked the comprehensive test ban treaty ( ctbt ) at the conference on disarmament in geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament .
new delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the conference on disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism .
india has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the united nations general assembly .
china said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations .
" the completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said .
china has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the united states that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord .
the newspaper said china advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance .
" some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said .
china held on july 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .
china was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .
japan declares food poisoning threat receding .
tokyo 1996-08-27
the government said on tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western japan city of sakai , where the epidemic hit the hardest .
the food poisoning epidemic caused by the o-157 colon bacillus in sakai appears to be " settling down " , health minister naoto kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet .
the o-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year .
sakai , near the regional commercial centre of osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease .
two children in sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria .
kan told a cabinet meeting on tuesday that no new victims have been reported since august 8 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for sakai .
sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved .
" there are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from september .
health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection .
the outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme .
the ministers agreed at tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in september and october , when schools around the country resume .
japan 's agriculture ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on u.s. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic .
as of monday , 31 children were still hospitalised in sakai city , of whom six were in serious condition .
japan aluminium shipments surge 8.9 pct in july .
tokyo 1996-08-27
japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in july surged 8.9 percent over the same month last year to 224,609 tonnes , while production rose 6.4 percent to 222,457 tonnes , according to preliminary data released on tuesday by the japan aluminium federation .
the surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said .
figures released two weeks ago from japan 's seven largest mills already showed that japan 's can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in july , reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption .
a federation official added that the half-year through september 1996 also appeared likely to set a new record for can production , despite cooler temperatures in august .
july inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes , down 2.6 percent from the prior month .
july foil output was off 0.2 percent year-on-year at 11,525 tonnes , while foil shipments fell 0.8 percent to 11,244 tonnes .
june mill output data were revised slightly downward to 210,622 tonnes from the preliminary 210,683 , while shipments were revised marginally upward to 213,989 tonnes from 213,845 .
final figures for june pegged can stock shipments at 40,144 tonnes , up 2.4 percent year-on-year .
shipments to the auto sector fell 5.5 percent to 15,286 tonnes , while the construction sector rose 2.4 percent to 79,390 tonnes .
exports dipped 3.7 percent to 18,867 tonnes .

china thanks gabon for support on human rights .
beijing 1996-08-27
china has publicly thanked gabon for its strong support at the united nations human rights commission , where beijing has come under attack from western nations for its human rights record .
china 's president jiang zemin offered his gratitude in a meeting on monday with visiting gabon president omar bongo , the official xinhua news agency said .
jiang also acknowledged the central african nation 's support for china 's stance on taiwan , which beijing views as a renegade province , while bongo was quoted as thanking china for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on monday .
in april , china quashed a draft resolution by the u.n. human rights commission expressing concern over continuing reports of beijing 's violations of fundamental freedoms .
after the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the european union and the united states , china 's foreign ministry thanked 26 countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document .
it was the sixth year in a row that china avoided censure at the u.n. 's main human rights forum .
china has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent .
a xinhua commentary earlier this year said a plot by the west to force its human rights standards and values on other countries was doomed to failure .
taiwan 's cooperative bank cuts prime lending rate .
taipei 1996-08-27
cooperative bank of taiwan , one of the island 's leading state-run banks , said it was cutting its prime lending rate by 0.05 percentage point , effective on tuesday .
the bank said in a statement it was cutting its prime lending rate to 7.35 percent from 7.40 percent .
it also would cut its three-month-to-three-year time deposit rates by between 0.05 and 0.10 percentage points .
the moves made cooperative the first major bank to cut rates in response to a call on friday from central bank governor sheu yuan-dong .
in the central bank 's latest bid to jumpstart taiwan 's sluggish economy , sheu ordered a reduction of up to a half-percentage point in banks ' reserve requirements and called on commercial banks to pass on the savings in the form of interest rate reductions .

palestinians to strike over jerusalem demolition .
jerusalem 1996-08-27
palestinian leaders in jerusalem called on tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called israel 's war on arab east jerusalem after police demolished a building there .
israeli police demolished a 10 metre ( yard ) by 20 metre structure in jerusalem 's old city they said had been built with funding from the palestinian self-rule authority for use as a social club .
police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the old city 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said .
bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 1991 and it had yet to be completed when the israeli police bulldozed it .
the palestinian authority was set up under the 1993 plo-israel interim peace deal .
" there has been a call for a general strike between one ( 1000 gmt ) and three o'clock , " palestinian lawmaker ahmed hashem zighayer told reuters .
" this is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . "
prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's government , which took office in june , has said it will not allow the authority , set up under a 1993 interim peace deal to control parts of the gaza strip and west bank , to operate in jerusalem .
israel 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to palestinian authority activity in the city .
tuesday 's demolition came a day after plo officials said they had bowed to netanyahu 's demand they close offices in jerusalem .
they said two of the three offices israel wanted closed had been shut .
netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the palestine liberation organisation ( plo ) .
israel captured arab east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war and annexed it .
it says it will never cede any part of the city .
palestinians want east jerusalem as capital of a future state .
the city is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under netanyahu .
sec adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices .
washington 1996-08-28
the securities and exchange commission wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders .
the so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last september , were approved in a 4-0 vote .
the new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them .
the rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .
specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .
in a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .
" these rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said sec chairman arthur levitt .
the sec 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . "
the director of the sec 's division of market regulation , richard lindsey , said wall street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules .
in proposing the rules last year , the sec noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .
it noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .
it also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices .
earlier this month , the sec settled charges of alleged malpractices on nasdaq when the parent of the nasdaq market , the national association of securities dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .
the sec dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .
the agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again .
the agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on nasdaq .
the sec 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed .
the president of the nasdaq , alfred berkeley , was to hold a news conference wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .
italian cabinet approves television decree .
rome 1996-08-28
the italian cabinet on wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul silvio berlusconi 's mediaset television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until january 31 , 1997 .
the decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels .
passengers injured in train collision in linz .
linz , austria 1996-08-28
a passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in linz on wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured .
austrian television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in linz , 300 km ( 180 miles ) west of vienna .
" one locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in linz told reuters by telephone .
the express passenger train travelling from steyr , southeast of linz , with around 80 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings .
the police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage .
doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added .
greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told austrian news agency apa .
saskatchewan wheat pool eyes hog market .
winnipeg 1996-08-28
canada 's largest grain handling firm said wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production .
" saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " saskatchewan wheat pool chief executive don loewen said in a company statement .
swp said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 .
the end of canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern prairie .
analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western prairie .
swp said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework .
saskatchewan pork international marketing group has an export monopoly but some saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .

martin ayres
manchester , england 1996-08-28
britain 's chris boardman fulfilled his prediction that he would break the world 4,000 metres world record in the world track cycling championships on wednesday .
boardman clocked four minutes 13.353 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 4:19.699 set by olympic champion andrea collinelli of italy in atlanta in july .
collinelli qualified in second place , also beating his old record in 4:17.696 .
" i was very nervous before the start but then i was amazed by the speed of my ride , " boardman said . "
i do n't know if i can go any faster .
who knows what will happen in the later stages ? "
boardman , 28 , did not contest the olympic pursuit because of its proximity to the tour de france in which he led the french gan team .
however , he took a bronze medal in the olympic road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the manchester indoor velodrome .
he adopted the " superman " riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow briton graeme obree , the 1995 world champion , and taken up in atlanta by collinelli .
obree was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection .
qualifiers for wednesday evening 's quarter-finals :
1. chris boardman ( britain ) 4:13.353

but he has had second thoughts since then . "
i 'm only 34 .
some say that 's too old for an athlete , " he said .

tennis - seles has walkover to u.s. open third round .
new york 1996-08-28
second seed and co-world number one monica seles advanced to the third round of the u.s. open tennis championships without hitting a ball on wednesday .
seles , the 1991 and 1992 champion who dropped just one game in her opening match , was scheduled to play laurence courtois of belgium wednesay night .
but tournament officials announced about four-and-a-half hours before the match that courtois had pulled out due to a left knee bone inflammation , moving seles into the next round on a walkover .
tennis - serious medvedev is having fun again .
richard finn
new york 1996-08-28
outspoken andrei medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again .
" i think i 'm much more focused on what i have to do , and that 's playing tennis , " medvedev said after routing frenchman jean-philippe fleurian 6-2 6-0 6-1 in the opening round of the u.s. open .
it was medvedev 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the hamlet cup .
" i realised this year , that without putting 99.9 percent of your mind into tennis , i do n't think you can successful , " said the 22-year-old medvedev .
" the whole day i 'm thinking abnout tennis .
i felt that all the other things i was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . "
for medvedev that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand .
" i know what i 'm here for , " said medvedev , who lost in the second round of the open the last two years after reaching the quarters in 1993 , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic .
" i 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court .
i 'm here to play tennis and to win .
i have much less fun off the court .
i have much more fun on the court , " he said .
just three years ago medvedev was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the french open semifinal and winning three tournaments .
but medvedev 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury .
the ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago .
" it 's somewhere where i would n't like to stay very long , " medvedev said of his current ranking of 36 . "
it 's a part of the penalty that i have to accept . "
as part of his new businesslike approach , medvedev hired australian coach bob brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off .
" at the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said medvedev . "
winning in long island ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . "
while medvedev 's 77-minute romp past fleurian was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable .
in the original draw , medvedev and fleurian were slotted to play each other .
when controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of 151-to-1 -- medvedev and fleurian drew each other a second time .
" when i saw the new draw i did n't have to change my preparation , " medvedev said . "
i think it 's destined that it turned out for me . "

tennis - graf works hard for first-round win .
bill berkrot
new york 1996-08-27
it was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion steffi graf to win her opening match at the u.s. open on tuesday night .
but the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked indonesian yayuk basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon .
graf , of course , prevailed 6-3 7-6 , but not before some tense moments that even had the german superstar thinking the match was going three sets .
" i won the second set , which i did n't think i would do , being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 , " graf recalled .
several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical graf-like efficiency tuesday .
as afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded spaniard conchita martinez took apart romanian ruxandra dragomir in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed monica seles , who opened the second-day programme by crushing american anne miller 6-0 6-1 .
third seed arantxa sanchez vicario , the 1994 champion , and eighth-seeded olympic gold medalist lindsay davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round .
but the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side .
fifth-seed iva majoli of croatia was picked off by austrian judith wiesner and wimbledon semifinalist kimiko date of japan , the 10th seed , fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked american kimberly po .
date 's defeat left no other seeded players in seles 's quarter of the draw , which lost anke huber ( 6 ) and maggie maleeva ( 12 ) on monday .
but graf , winner of 20 grand slam titles , was not about to join that list .
" at some points i felt a little nervous , " she admitted . "
when it came down to the important points , i felt more confident . "
basuki , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead .
graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order .
but basuki , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on graf 's serve at 6-5 before the german unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break .
" i lost the moment , " lamented basuki , who has reached the fourth round at wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in montreal earlier this month .
still , the feisty indonesian got off to a 3-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave graf her chance to avoid a third set .
" usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , " said graf , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker .
" to be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . "
baseball - sosa has surgery , out up to six weeks .
chicago 1996-08-27
chicago cubs right fielder sammy sosa underwent surgery on monday to remove a fractured bone from his right hand and will miss four to six weeks , the club announced tuesday .
sosa , a leading candidate for national league most valuable player honours , was injured august 20th when he was hit by a mark hutton pitch in the first inning of an 8-1 victory over the florida marlins .
the 27-year-old sosa leads the league with 40 homers and is tied for 10th with 100 rbi .
the loss of sosa , who appeared in all 124 games this season , is a huge blow to the cubs ' playoff hopes .
soccer - marcelo hat-trick keeps psv at top of dutch league .
amsterdam 1996-08-28
brazilian striker marcelo scored a hat-trick as psv eindhoven maintained their 100 percent record and stayed on top of the dutch first division with a 3-1 win at volendam on wednesday .
psv 's main rivals for the title , defending champions ajax amsterdam , celebrated the novelty of having the roof of their new 51,000 seat stadium closed against the rain , with a 1-0 win over az alkmaar .
ajax were missing six first-team players but frank de boer shot home the winner from a 20-metre free kick in the 30th minute of a dull game .
marcelo , signed in close season to replace compatriot ronaldo who left to play for barcelona , opened the psv scoring in the 19th minute when he fired home after good work from rene eijkelkamp .
the brazilian found the mark again two minutes after halftime and again in the 56th minute before midfielder pascal jongsma scored a consolation goal for volendam five minutes from time .
feyenoord rotterdam suffered an early shock when they went 1-0 down after four minutes against de graafschap doetinchem .
the equaliser came in the 73rd minute when swedish international henke larsson scored from close range and 10 minutes later jean-paul van gastel gave feyenoord a 2-1 victory from the penalty spot .
after three matches psv lead the first division with nine points , three points clear of fifth-placed ajax .
soccer - robson wins first trophy with barcelona .
madrid 1996-08-28
former england manager bobby robson enjoyed his first success in charge of barcelona as his team weathered 90 minutes of non-stop atletico madrid pressure to win the spanish super cup 6-5 on aggregate on wednesday .
barcelona had won the first leg 5-2 but the second leg was a different story .
atletico came within a whisker of taking the cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 3-1 ahead 15 minutes from the end .
juan lopez gave atletico the lead midway through the first half after barcelona fullback albert ferrer and substitute goalkeeper julen lopetegui failed to clear a milinko pantic cross .
barcelona 's hristo stoichkov made his only significant contribution of the evening 10 minutes after halftime when sergi barjuan broke down the right to set up the fiery bulgarian with a simple equaliser .
but atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing juan eduardo esnaider and then serbian set-piece specialist pantic made it 3-1 with a superb free-kick in the 75th minute .
robson praised atletico after the game , which was played in the community of madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the vicente calderon ground .
the venue of atletico 's first league game , scheduled for sunday , is still in doubt with the real madrid 's santiago bernabeu a distinct possibility .

amsterdam 1996-08-28
argentine striker iwan cesar gabrich signed a five year contract with dutch champions ajax amsterdam on wednesday .
the 24-year-old gabrich , who signed for an undisclosed fee from the argentine side newell old boys , is set to join dutch international patrick kluivert in the ajax forward line .
he is ajax 's sixth new signing this year , joining midfielder richard witschge , defenders john veldman and mariano juan and strikers tijjani babangida and dani .
soccer - parma , roma and udinese out of italian cup .
rome 1996-08-28
uefa cup hopefuls parma and roma , under new coaches this season , crashed out of the italian cup to second division opponents on wednesday while league champions milan could only draw 1-1 at humble empoli .
wealthy parma , now coached by the former italian international carlo ancelotti , were without new striker enrico chiesa and went down 3-1 at serie b club pescara in their second round clash .
pescara 's ottavio palladini shattered parma with goals in the second and fourth minutes .
midfielder marco giampaolo made it 3-0 in the 38th minute and parma 's alessandro melli pulled back a late goal six minutes from time .
the second round was the entry point for the bulk of the serie a sides with the winners going through .
the later stages of the cup are played over two legs .
parma 's defeat was a repeat of last season 's fiasco when they lost their opening cup match 3-0 to palermo .
roma , now coached by argentine carlos bianchi and watched by italian national coach arrigo sacchi , lost 3-1 to cesena -- another repeat of last season when the rome club also went out at the first hurdle .
udinese , with germany 's euro ' 96 hero oliver bierhoff in their lineup , completed the hat-trick of beaten serie a sides when they went under 2-1 to newly relegated cremonese .
milan 's new uruguayan coach oscar tabarez avoided the nightmare of defeat but faces a replay at home next sunday .
cup holders fiorentina easily beat cosenza 3-1 while european cup holders juventus also cruised through with a 2-0 win at small southern club fidelis andria .
two other serie a sides lost at the weekend -- piacenza and last year 's losing finalists atalanta .
two cup matches could not be played on wednesday due to argument over first round results .
lecce 's 3-0 weekend defeat of genoa was expected to be overturned by a sporting judge on thursday after the home club fielded an ineligible player .
that would set genoa up for a second round match against local rivals sampdoria .
nocerina 's 4-3 defeat of piacenza was also subject to a complaint , later removed , that forced their second round match against serie a newcomers perugia to be delayed .
soccer - bayern hit four to take bundesliga top spot .
bonn 1996-08-28
goals from thomas helmer and juergen klinsmann helped bayern munich to a 4-2 home win over bayer leverkusen on wednesday and powered them to the top of the bundesliga .
the comfortable victory gave bayern 10 points from their first four games , a point ahead of second-placed stuttgart , who have a game in hand .
brazilian midfielder paulo sergio put leverkusen ahead in the 25th minute but alexander zickler equalised just a minute later .
a header from helmer and an acrobatic strike from klinsmann gave bayern a two-goal cushion at halftime .
but the pick of the 13-times champions ' goals came from ruggiero rizzitelli , who beat three defenders to put bayern 4-1 up .
markus feldhoff hit a consolation goal for leverkusen .
hansa rostock brought cologne 's 100 percent record to an end with a 2-0 win over the rhineside club while a sean dundee hat-trick inside seven minutes stood out in karlsruhe 's 4-0 demolition of st pauli .

soccer - smicer 's last-gasp goal keeps lens in the lead .
paris 1996-08-28
euro 96 star vladimir smicer of the czech republic scored at the last second for lens , allowing them to retain the lead in the french soccer league on wednesday .
smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 3-2 victory over montpellier , who were leading 2-1 until cameroon 's marc-vivien foe equalised on a header in the 85th minute .
the win was the fourth in as many matches this season for lens , who lead the table on 12 points .
in-form paris st germain , who dismissed nantes 1-0 , are second with 10 points .
along with smicer , robert pires was the star of the night in france , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in metz 's 3-1 home victory over neighbouring strasbourg .
pires , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by french manager aime jacquet for a friendly against mexico on saturday at the parc des princes .
pires scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break .
a solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th .
smicer 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory .
spurred by foe 's leveller five minutes before , lens pressed hard and foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header .
the ball bounced back to smicer 's feet and he scored .
montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to kader ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from lens goalkeeper jean-claude nadon .
the side from northern france , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to tony vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker fabien lefevre made it two for montpellier five minutes later .
league favourites psg scored a convincing 1-0 win over nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season .
ironically , psg 's victory owed a lot to two former nantes players , striker patrice loko , who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute , and defender benoit cauet , who started the one-two which allowed loko to score .
the parisians , who have yet to concede a goal , were without brazil 's leonardo and panama 's julio cesar dely valdes , both called up by their national sides .
for nantes , who shocked psg to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful .
the canaries , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season .
reigning champions auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against marseille on tuesday .

athletics - christie and johnson asked to join owens ' tribute .
adrian warner
bonn 1996-08-28
organisers hope to persuade britain 's former olympic 100 metres champion linford christie to join a " dream team " sprint relay in a special tribute to jesse owens at friday 's berlin grand prix .
christie , who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season , was not due to compete in the german capital but berlin promoter rudi thiel said : " we are still hopeful of getting him to come . "
thiel has managed to get most of the olympic 100 metres champions since 1948 to attend the meeting , which is being held in the stadium where owens won four gold medals 60 years ago at the berlin olympics .
canada 's donovan bailey , the olympic 100 metres champion and world record holder , and namibian frankie fredericks , the silver medallist at the recent atlanta games , have already agreed to run in the 4x100 metres team .
thiel said on wednesday that he had also asked olympic 200 and 400 champion michael johnson to run as well as christie .
" most of the olympic champions of the past are coming including britain 's ( 1980 champion ) allan wells .
christie belongs to them .
it would be great to have him here .
" there is a good offer ....
my minimum would be that he just ran the relay , " he said .
the 36-year-old briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on wednesday .
owens 's widow ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter 's relatives is expected to attend .
the relay race , which will include squads from africa , the united states and europe as well as the owens ' quartet , will be held at the end of the meeting .
organisers had hoped to include 1984 and 1988 champion carl lewis in the squad but he injured himself in brussels last friday .
cricket - new captain tendulkar upstaged by 120 from jayasuriya .
colombo 1996-08-28
sachin tendulkar marked his debut as indian captain with a patient 110 on wednesday , but was upstaged by dashing sri lankan opener sanath jayasuriya whose 120 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket singer cup win .
sri lanka , playing in front of their home crowd for the first time since winning the world cup last march , comfortably passed india 's modest 226-5 from 50 overs in 44.2 overs .
the devastating opening pair of jayasuriya and romesh kaluwitharana shared a fine first wicket stand of 129 to the delight of the 25,000 fans .
jayasuriya , whose first 50 included three sixes and three fours , went on to an unbeaten 120 and the man-of-the-match award .
kaluwitharana , slow in comparison , was bowled by tendulkar for 53 , but aravinda de silva with 49 not out helped see sri lanka home .
earlier , tendulkar completed his ninth century in one-day cricket , taking 138 balls to do it before being run out .
the rest of the indian batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling , although ex-captain mohamed azharuddin chipped in with 58 , adding 129 with tendulkar off 28 overs , before being stumped .
the next match in the four-nation tournament is on friday when sri lanka play australia in a repeat of the world cup final in lahore where sri lanka won by seven wickets .

jornal de angola
- princeton lyman , the u.s. under-secretary of state for international organisations , will on wednesday continue his work in angola visiting bailundo , where he should be received by jonas savimbi , leader of unita .
on tuesday lyman participated in a meeting of a joint-commission where he considered that the angolan politicians should advance faster and find a way to cooperate .
in his opinion the quartering of unita forces must be concluded in all the angolan territory and the troops must be selected and integrated in the armed forces , the government forces must be concentrated in the principal units and the free circulation of people and goods must be reality in all the country .
s.african truth body to summon apartheid police .
cape town 1996-08-28
south africa 's truth and reconciliation commission said on wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it .
" we can subpoena anyone we want to , even the president of the country , " spokesman john allen told reuters . "
subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week . "
media reports have speculated that the commission , which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past , could subpoena apartheid-era president p.w. botha and former police generals basie smit and johan van der merwe .
in submissions last week to the commission national party leader and former president f.w. de klerk said he had received no co-operation from botha in compiling his party 's report .
since it began work in april the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses , by both the white minority regime and its opponents .
it also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses , to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness .
hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear .
allen declined to give say who would be subpoenaed .
" at the moment we have a preliminary list of less than 10 people , but this is just the beginning , " he said .
the commission was set up last year to probe 30 years of human-rights violations during the apartheid era .
it is chaired by nobel peace winner , retired archbishop desmond tutu .
allen said the commission could announce the names of subpoenaed persons on monday next week .
turkish airplane lands in sofia on bomb threat .

" the plane landed at sofia airport at 1503 ( 1203 gmt ) after receiving a signal that there is an explosive on board , " the official , who declined to be named told reuters .
the plane , surrounded by 11 fire-engines , is being checked for explosives at the moment .
nothing has been found so far , added the official .
in march a turkish cypriot airliner hijacked while on a flight from northern cyprus to istanbul landed in sofia airport to refuel before landing in munich , where the hijacker was arrested .
arch alberta well tests 1,100 bbl / day .
fort worth , texas 1996-08-28
arch petroleum inc said wednesday an exploratory well in alberta 's morinville area tested in excess of 1,100 barrels daily and will begin production immediately .
the company said the 90 percent owned trax et al morinville 10-23 logged 28 feet of productive leduc reef at 5,350 feet .
reserve estimates from this well are at 250,000 gross barrels of oil .
the trax well is one of the prospects developed by arch through its early 1996 purchase of trax petroleums ltd , the company said .
it said another , the cometra et al morinville 11-13 , has logged 128 feet of productive leduc reef at 5,400 feet and is flowing water free at the rate of 590 barrels of oil per day on a 15 / 64ths-inch choke .
arch owns a 16 percent working interest in this well with most of the rest held by the privately owned operator .
arch said full production has begun and initial estimates of gross reserves attributable to this well range up to one million barrels of oil .
a third well drilled in this area , the trax et al morinville 2-25 , encountered the leduc reef but tested wet .
at the company 's nordegg prospect , the apache et al saunders 14-28 , has reached total depth in the leduc reef at approximately 3,800 feet and has been abandoned , arch said .
it said this acreage earning well brought an interest in an additional 5,120 acres , building the company 's gross land position in this area to 8,320 acres .
at the butte prospect , the garrington 4-8 has reached total depth of 11,500 and has logged 278 feet of leduc reef .
testing has begun and results will be announced within the next several days , arch said .
including the costs of the two abandoned wells , the company said , these first prospects have added to reserves at a finding cost of about u.s. $ 2 per barrel of oil equivalent .

u.s. judge orders biogen , berlex officials deposed .
leslie gevirtz
boston 1996-08-28
in order to help him decide whether he should hear the case , a u.s. district court judge wednesday ordered the legal counsels of biogen inc and berlex laboratories , a subsidiary of schering ag , deposed .
the tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the u.s. food and drug administration violated the orphan drug law by allowing biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug avonex .
berlex also charges that avonex is so similar to its ms drug , betaseron , that it is a patent infringement .
both drugs are types of interferon .
one analyst said sales of avonex had already cut into betaseron market share .
biovest research , inc 's analyst eddie hedaya said , " berlex sales are losing share like mad ...
my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations . "
he added chiron corp reported its sales of inventory to berlex was down .
chiron makes betaseron ; berlex markets it , he said .
biogen , in its securities and exchange commission quarterly report for the period ending june 30 , said it had earned $ 6.1 million from avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market .
when it approved avonex in may , the fda said both biogen 's product and betaseron were developed under the incentives of the ophran drug act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases .
avonex " has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon beta-1b ( betaseron ) ..
. "
the fda said .
now , u.s. district judge mark wolf has ordered the chief counsel for biogen , michael astrue , and robert chabora , his counterpart at berlex be deposed about a may 21 meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by biogen against berlex should be heard in massachusetts .
berlex filed a lawsuit against biogen in u.s. district court in newark , n.j. in july , but biogen had already filed a suit against berlex in massachusetts in may .
wolf ordered the depositions to determine if he or u.s. district judge john bissell of newark should preside over the case .

comex copper ends higher after late recovery .
new york 1996-08-28
comex copper ended higher after a late , modest recovery dragged the market from the lows , but traders shrugged-off an imminent strike at codelco 's salvador mine in chile .
the market was also waiting for friday 's lme stock report which will include figures delayed from tuesday because of the u.k. public holiday on monday when the lme was closed .
" we are in the late stages of the weaker period of the market , and as we get to the post labor day market we will start to see more consumer interest and the demand side of the market will start to firm prices up , " said william o'neill of merrill lynch .
december comex settled 0.35 cent higher at 90.20 cents , traded 90.50 to 89.40 cents .
september went out 0.05 cent lower at 91.05 .
the august contract expired at 0.85 cent down at 90.85 cents .
volume was estimated at 8,000 lots .
workers at salvador voted to strike from saturday , and it was not clear when further talks between the unions and management would take place .
" salvador is a small facility , and the prospects are that if there will be a strike , it will not be a long strike , " o'neill said .

new york 1996-08-28
chile 's state oil company empresa nacional del petroleo ( enap ) bought a second spot cargo of oriente and nearly one million barrels of escravos in a recent tender , traders said wednesday .
a 400,000 barrel cargo of ecuadorian oriente and 960,000 barrels of nigerian escravos was awarded in a tender for oct 15-18 late last week , but price information remains vague .

escravos was sold on a dated brent related basis , with premiums for the light grade seen in the low 50-cent range .
the next purchase tender from enap is expected for late october or early november crude , traders said .

vancouver , british columbia 1996-08-28
canada is fast-tracking immigration applications from chinese dissidents in hong kong before the british colony reverts to china 's control next year , the vancouver sun reported on wednesday .
the applications are being " fast-tracked in the sense that we are processing them and the ones who have been referred to us have been interviewed , " the newspaper quoted garrett lambert , canada 's high commissioner in hong kong , as saying .
" a small number already have preliminary indications as to what the disposition of their cases are and so i suppose in that sense , i guess we have given them some preferential treatment , " lambert said .
he declined to say how many people were being considered for asylum .
canada 's ministry of foreign affairs in ottawa had no immediate comment on the report .
about 80 chinese dissidents are believed to be living in exile in hong kong .
their fate after the territory reverts to chinese rule is unclear .
britain hands hong kong back to china at midnight on june 30 , 1997 , after 150 years of colonial rule .
canada 's minister of foreign affairs lloyd axworthy said after meeting hong kong gov .
chris patten last month that canada may grant asylum to dissidents who have fled to hong kong from china .
chinese officials have said such dissidents may not become hong kong permanent residents since they entered the territory illegally but have also said their status would be decided by the post-1997 local hong kong administration .

guinea launches war on fictitious civil servants .
conakry 1996-08-28
guinea launched a drive on wednesday to rid the civil service payroll of fictitious workers as part of new prime minister sidia toure 's campaign to cut government spending .
deputy minister for finance ousmane kaba said teams of inspectors would check government offices in the capital and the provinces to root out civil servants who drew salaries but had left their jobs , were dead , or had never existed .
some 50 million guinean francs ( $ 50,000 ) has been pumped into the exercise to deter the inspectors from taking bribes .
kaba told reporters the annual wage bill of 171 billion guinean francs represented 50 percent of current state expenditure , " whereas the acceptable proportion in countries similar to ours is one third " .
toure , who took office last month , has said he plans to cut public service spending by 30 percent by the end of the year as part of measures to revive the economy .
guinea is rich in minerals and has a vast potential for hydroelectric power generation but it faces stiff competition from its west african neighbours for foreign investment .
president lansana conte appointed toure , a former senior civil servant in ivory coast , last month to clean up the administration and reform the economy following february 's bloody army revolt .

nigeria rights group says four academics arrested .
lagos 1996-08-28
a nigerian human rights group said on wednesday that four members of a recently banned university union had been arrested .
" the constitutional rights project ( crp ) believes that william istafanus , elisha shamay , o.k. likkason and jerome egurugbe were arrested because of their role in the ongoing asuu ( academic staff union of universities ) strike , " the group said in a statement .
the crp said the four were arrested on monday night at the northeastern tafawa balewa university .
the main academic union , asuu , along with two smaller university unions , was banned by nigeria 's military government last week , because of a four-month strike by teachers for better working conditions .
nigeria is under fire from many western countries for human rights abuses and lack of democracy .

dutroux suspected in murder of slovak woman .
peter laca
bratislava 1996-08-28
marc dutroux , the chief accused in a belgian child murder and sex abuse scandal , is suspected of murdering a young slovak woman , the slovak office of interpol said on wednesday .
rudolf gajdos , head of slovak interpol , told a news conference dutroux was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one slovak woman .
" one of the police versions in the case of the murder of young gypsy woman in topolcany , western slovakia , this july , is a suspicion that mark dutroux could have been involved in the murder , " gajdos said without elaborating on the age of the victim and on the other versions .
slovak police , interpol , and belgian police have been following leads on dutroux 's activities in slovakia and the neighbouring czech republic where he is known to have made frequent visits .
gajdos said the police sketch of the suspected murderer was " 60 percent identical with dutroux 's portrait " , and that dutroux was known to have been in topolcany around the time of the woman 's murder .
" topolcany and the area around this town were reported to have been the most visited places by dutroux and his accomplices in slovakia , " gajdos said .
dutroux , a convicted child rapist and unemployed father-of-three , led police 11 days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo in the garden of another of the six houses he owns around the southern belgian city of charleroi .
" the belgian police also informed us that dutroux , together with one other man , had ( also ) planned the kidnapping of at least one slovak woman , " gajdos said .
" the plan apparently failed due to difficulties in crossing the border , " he added , but did not elaborate .
the slovak police are also investigating visits by about 10 slovak women , aged 17 to 22 , to belgium , at the invitation of dutroux .
the women said they went to belgium voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films , gajdos said earlier this week .
but he added they had difficulty remembering what happened during their visits to belgium , perhaps because of drugs , and were unsure whether they were filmed for pornography .
dutroux , 39 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two girls aged 14 and 12 , is also suspected in the disappearance of belgians an marchal , 19 , and eefje lambrecks , 17 , who went missing a year ago .
knifeman kills polish beauty queen , wounds husband .
warsaw 1996-08-28
a man knifed to death international model agnieszka kotlarska outside her home in wroclaw , western poland , polish television said on wednesday .
the man , who said he had once been engaged to her , first knifed kotlarska 's husband in the leg , then stabbed her three times in the chest when she tried to intervene during the incident on tuesday .
she died in hospital .
kotlarska , who was 24 and had a three-year-old child , was miss poland in 1991 and went on to a u.s.-based modelling career that included working with italian designer gianni versace and vogue magazine , the gazeta wyborcza newspaper said .
she had been due to fly on a twa airliner which exploded near new york last month , but had cancelled her booking , the newspaper said .
her attacker , identified only as jerzy l. , 36 , was arrested by police and will appear in court on thursday morning , television reported .
it said he had admitted the attack but had denied intending to kill kotlarska .
russian shares slip in thin volume .
moscow 1996-08-28
leading russian shares edged down on wednesday in thin volume in the absence of western orders , traders said .
the russian trading system index of 21 issues fell 1.64 percent to 180.38 on volume of $ 4.38 million .
" the market was extremely quiet today , some profit-taking locally , no western orders , " said nick mokhoff , director of sales and trade at alliance-menatep . "
we are just a bit lower with a lot of inactivity during the whole day . "
alexander babayan , managing director at centrinvest securities , said the volume of orders was four to five times lower than a week ago .
as often , the most volume was in ues .
" unified is one of the blue chips , which has more prospects than anybody else does , because they have adrs supposedly coming up , " mokhoff said .
ues officials said last week the board had not yet approved the final version of its application to the u.s. securities and exchange commission to issue adrs .
ues fell to $ 0.0817 from $ 0.0822 at tuesday 's close with 8.90 million shares changing hands .
gazprom was the loser of the day with prices closing at $ 0.300 , down from $ 0.355 on tuesday and $ 0.445 on monday .
mokhoff said uncertainty about when gazprom would issue adrs and about whether shares from the russian market could be converted into adrs had hurt prices .
" western investors ... will be investing in adrs and i do not think people in russia will be able to come up with the money for the underlying shares to drive the russian shares to those levels , " mokhoff said .
gazprom has also tightened the rules restricting shareholers ' rights to trade its shares .
mosenergo closed at at $ 0.958 after $ 0.966 , rostelekom fell to $ 2.56 from $ 2.58 and lukoil was $ 9.82 after $ 9.85 .

tirana 1996-08-28
albania asked greece on wednesday to explain why it was deporting more albanian immigrants , foreign minister tritan shehu said .
the albanian daily koha jone reported earlier that greece had deported about 5,000 albanians in the last five days .
" the foreign ministry is trying to find out from the greek embassy why albanian refugees have been deported from greece , " shehu told reuters .
athens and tirana signed an accord in may to legalise the status of albanian immigrant workers , estimated at 350,000 , and remove a long-standing stumbling block in relations between the two balkan neighbours .
bulgarians recover 75 pct of confiscated land .
sofia 1996-08-28
bulgaria has restored ownership rights to pre-communist private owners of 75 percent of the arable land or around four million hectares , an agriculture ministry official said on wednesday .
" so far 75 percent has been returned with the land restitution almost completed in some regions like southeastern bulgaria but lagging behind in other areas , predominantly in the mountains , " the official told a news conference .
the ministry has said that it planned to return 96.6 percent of the arable land or 5.2 million hectares to its original owners by the end of this year .
a land reform act passed four years ago abolished soviet-style collective farms , allowing the return of 5.4 million hectares to original owners or their heirs .

german chancellor to meet yeltsin sept 7 - interfax .
moscow 1996-08-28
german chancellor helmut kohl , who spoke to president boris yeltsin by telephone on wednesday , plans a trip to moscow on september 7 and will visit yeltsin at his vacation home near moscow , interfax news agency said .
interfax , quoting yeltsin press secretary sergei yastrzhembsky , said yeltsin and kohl had discussed bilateral relations and international issues on the telephone .
yeltsin had told kohl about efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in russia 's breakaway chechnya region , interfax added .
yeltsin , who left on vacation on monday , is staying at an exclusive private hunting lodge some 100 km ( 60 miles ) from moscow .
germany has been one of the loudest critics of russia 's military intervention in chechnya , a 20-month-old conflict in which tens of thousands of people have been killed .
exiled bosnians protest confusing voting rules .
duncan shiels
nagyatad , hungary 1996-08-28
bosnian refugees in hungary , the first to vote last weekend in their country 's first post-war election , found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for , refugees and officials said on wednesday .
" for the most part they really did n't understand what was going on , " the director of the nagyatad camp lajos horvath told reuters on wednesday .
" it was confusing , they had no experience of voting , many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates , " he said .
" they just voted along ethnic lines where they could . "
the bosnian election is set for september 14 and voting began on wednesday for most of the 600,000 bosnians living abroad .
the organisation for security and cooperation in europe , which is running the election , allowed the ballot to be held on sunday in four hungarian refugee camps .
some moslem refugees among the 385 registered voters hungary 's largest camp nagyatad have written to the osce complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the bosnian-croat federation , where most moslems live .
this was because their pre-war homes are now in the serb-controlled territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the republika srbska , most of the candidates for which are serbs .
for the foreign powers which back last year 's dayton peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state .
but adem hodzic , one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint , told reuters :
" we only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other bosnian moslems to choose our president .
this vote seals the division of my country . "
under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and house of representatives for all bosnia-hercegovina and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the moslem-croat federation or the republika srbska .
on sunday voters in hungary also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the osce on tuesday .
husein micijevic , who also signed the letter , alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them .
" probably 100 refugees were shown where to put their cross , " he said .
seventy eight-year-old mandolina zelic , a bosnian croat who has spent the last five years in nagyatad , told reuters she had cast her ballot because she 'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for .
" at first the organisers would n't let anyone help me but when they saw i did n't understand a young translator ringed the names i had to mark , " she said . "
i do n't know who i voted for . "
maria szabo of the hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the osce told reuters on wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed osce instructions very carefully .
" the envelopes , each with the five different voting slips , were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote , " she said . "
but of course those who could not read had to be shown . "
estonia presidential race next round on sept 20 .
tallinn 1996-08-28
estonia will hold the next round of an inconclusive state presidential race on september 20 , parliamentary officers of the baltic state ruled on wednesday .
this comes after three votes in the 101-strong parliament on monday and tuesday failed to give either incumbent lennart meri or rival candidate arnold ruutel the necessary 68 votes for a clear mandate .
the outcome was a rebuff for meri , failing three times to win backing in his bid for a second term as head of state of the former soviet republic .
parliament 's press officer told reuters that speaker toomas savi will convene an electoral college involving 101 mps and and 273 local government representatives on september 20 .
both meri , 67 , and ruutel , 68 will automatically be listed as candidates but the election will also be open to new nominations with the backing of any 21 members of the college .
the winner has to secure a majority from the college within two rounds of voting otherwise the election will go back before the parliament .
lebed likely to fail on chechnya - polish minister .
warsaw 1996-08-28
russian security chief aleksander lebed faces an almost impossible task in chechnya and is likely to be sidelined , polish foreign minister dariusz rosati was reported as saying on wednesday .
according to best-selling daily gazeta wyborcza , rosati told the polish parliament 's foreign affairs committee on tuesday that the fact lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in chechnya showed he would be marginalised .
" it is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted rosati as saying during a committee debate .
" lebed has no diplomatic experience .
yeltsin sent him there to compromise him .
this tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said .
lebed , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern russia region , was in moscow this week seeking support for a deal on chechnya 's political status .
but russian president boris yeltsin has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on monday .
gazeta wyborcza quoted rosati as saying yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators .
rosati said russia 's july polls , in which yeltsin won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the russian people had chosed the path of further reforms .
but he said a power struggle in russia 's ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms .
he expressed concern over problems in the russian economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported .
on moscow 's foreign policy , rosati said it had changed its stance on nato 's eastward expansion and was preparing itself for poland 's inevitable entry into the western alliance .
he also reportedly criticised russian foreign minister yevgeny primakov , saying his style of work resembled that of the soviet-era 1970s and 1980s .
romania state budget soars in june .
bucharest 1996-08-28
romania 's state budget deficit jumped sharply in june to 1,242.9 billion lei for the january-june period from 596.5 billion lei in january-may , official data showed on wednesday .
six-month expenditures stood at 9.50 trillion lei , up from 7.56 trillion lei at end-may , with education and health spending accounting for 31.6 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 26 percent .
january-june revenues went up to 8.26 trillion lei from 6.96 trillion lei in the first five months this year .
romania 's government is expected to revise the 1996 budget on wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation , new wage and pension indexations and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit .
under the revised version state spending is expected to rise by some 566 billion lei .
no new deficit forecast has been issued so far .
in july the government gave a 6.0-percent wage and pension indexation to cover energy , fuel and bread price increases , which quickened inflation to 7.5 percent last month .
in the original state budget , approved in march , revenues were envisaged at around 16.98 trillion lei and expenditures 20.17 trillion lei for 1996 .
the state budget deficit was originally forecast to be 3.19 trillion lei for the whole year .
on wednesday , the leu 's official rate was 3,161 to the dollar .

costa rica says dutch pair kidnapped by nicaraguans .
san jose , costa rica 1996-08-28
the costa rican government said on wednesday that a dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern costa rica was kidnapped by former nicaraguan guerrillas .
" even though it 's an act of common delinquency , the case could take a difficult turn because former nicaraguan guerrillas are involved , " security minister bernardo arce told reporters .
earlier this year , a german tourist and a swiss tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern costa rica near the nicaraguan border .
they were held for 71 days before relatives paid a ransom to free them .
two nicaraguan former guerrillas have been arrested in the case .
because of the apparent threat to foreigners in costa rica near the nicaraguan border , arce said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own .
hurte sierd zylstra and his wife , jetsi hendrika coers , both 50 years old , were seized late on saturday or early on sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car , leaving behind a ransom note demanding $ 1.5 million .
the plantation is owned by dutch citizen ebe huizinga , who has since arrived in costa rica to deal with the matter .
gov't dodging extradition , colombian official says .
bogota , colombia 1996-08-28
a top judicial official and critic of president ernesto samper accused the government of indifference on wednesday over efforts to lift colombia 's five-year-old ban on extradition .
" it would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government , " deputy prosecutor-general adolfo salamanca said .
constitutional reforms were proposed on tuesday by two senators , one of them a member of samper 's own liberal party , aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in 1991 .
u.s. ambassador myles frechette applauded the move , saying it could prompt the clinton administration to remove colombia from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in u.s. counternarcotics efforts .
samper -- who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money -- appeared less than enthusiastic , however .
" extradition is not on the government 's legislative agenda , " he told reporters on tuesday .
he added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue .
but he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting colombian drug lords onto u.s.-bound flights to serve stiff penalities in american prisons .
salamanca , who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in colombia , has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that samper 's campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country 's top drug lords .
quake shakes costa rica during hashimoto visit .
san jose , costa rica 1996-08-28
a moderate earthquake measuring 5.0 on the richter scale shook costa rica on wednesday during a visit by japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto , but there were no reports of casualties or damage , officials said .
the quake struck at 11.16 a.m. ( 1716 gmt ) and was centred 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of the port of quepos , which is 90 miles ( 140 km ) south of the capital san jose , the costa rican volcanic and seismologicial observatory said .
the quake was felt for about seven seconds in most of the country but preliminary reports said no one was hurt , it added .
the quake took place a few minutes before the end of a welcoming ceremony at juan santamaria airport for hashimoto , who was starting a three-hour visit as part of a latin american tour .
hashimoto , who arrived at 11 a.m. ( 1700 gmt ) , showed no sign of having felt the quake , witnesses said .

plo council calls for halt to contacts with israel .
ramallah , west bank 1996-08-28
the palestinian legislative council on wednesday called for a halt to contacts with israel , just hours after president yasser arafat said the jewish state had effectively declared war on the palestinians by pursuing its hardline policies .
a resolution released by the council called for " halting contacts with the israeli side and leaving the mechanism to carry out this to palestinian president yasser arafat " .
the council was meeting in ramallah to discuss israel 's new policy of jewish settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on jerusalem since prime minister benjamin netanyahu took office in june .
council resolutions are not necessarily binding .
arafat had earlier blasted israel saying its policies amounted to a declaration of war against the palestinian people .
he also called for the first general strike in two years in the west bank and gaza on thursday .
" what happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the palestinian people , " arafat told the council .
council speaker ahmed korei said the decision was part of a comprehensive plan to confront israeli settlement policy , land confiscation and what he termed other violations of the israeli-plo peace deals .
iraqi kurd group says agrees new ceasefire .

an iraqi kurdish group on wednesday said it had agreed a new u.s.-brokered ceasefire with a rival faction after a previous accord was shattered by sporadic fighting between the groups in recent days .
" the patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) leadership declares its endorsement for a ceasefire arrangement with the kdp ( kurdistan democratic party ) to take effect as of 8:00 a.m. on august 28 , " the puk said in a statement .
the puk said the ceasefire was agreed after talks between u.s. assistant secretary for near east affairs robert pelletreau and puk leader jalal talabani .

kurd group says iraqi troops massing near north .
ankara 1996-08-28
an iraqi kurdish group on wednesday said iraq was massing troops near kurdish regions in the north , where a u.s.-led allied air force protects the local population against attacks from baghdad .
" the iraqi regime has started threatening the kurdish population by massing troops in preparation to attack kurdish towns and population centres , " the patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) said in a statement .
the puk said it had received confirmed reports that iraqi troops , supported by tanks , artillery and armoured vehicles , have already penetrated some kurdish areas .
it said the military presence reflects cooperation between president saddam hussein and the puk 's rival , the kurdistan democratic party ( kdp ) .
the puk statement follows kdp assertions that the puk is receiving military support from iran .
hostilities between the two warring iraqi kurdish factions have continued in the last few days despite a u.s.-brokered ceasefire last friday .
the puk called on the united nations and allied forces to halt the iraqi aggression .
u.s. , french and british aircraft have safeguarded the iraqi kurdish population against aggression from baghdad since shortly after the gulf war in 1991 .
the allied force , known as operation provide comfort , is based in southern turkey .
iraq says hijackers were not diplomats .
baghdad 1996-08-28
iraq on wednesday said the hijackers of a sudanese airliner were not iraqi diplomats and added that " noble iraqis " would never contemplate such an action .
the official iraqi news agency ( ina ) quoted iraq 's ambassador in khartoum as saying that iraq 's embassy in the sudanese capital had nothing to do with the monday night hijacking .
iraq 's ambassador in khartoum denounced the hijacking and described it as a terrorist act which had nothing to do " with the morals and values of noble iraqis , " ina said .
ambassador abdulsamad hameed ali told ina there was only one diplomat among the 199 passengers and crew on the sudan airways airbus .
" he was not involved ...
on the contrary he was harassed by the elements which carried out the hijacking , " he said .
ina did not say the hijackers were iraqis .
the hijack started when the flight left khartoum for amman on monday night .
the hijackers told the crew they had grenades and other explosives and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not taken to london .
the airliner refuelled at larnaca , cyprus and landed at london 's stansted airport in the early hours of tuesday .
seven iraqi suspected hijackers surrendered and british police said they had apparently asked for political asylum .
several had brought their families along , including children .
dole blasts clinton for ignoring teen drug use .
judith crosson
ventura , calif. 1996-08-28
republican presidential candidate bob dole wednesday accused the clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the national guard to stop drugs from entering the united states .
" he 'll probably mention his war on drugs , which he 's going to start like everything else -- next year .
it 's too late , mr. president , " dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school .
he also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales . "
welcome to the club .
we 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks , " dole said .
dole said former first lady nancy reagan was laughed at with her " just say no " anti-drug message . "
but it worked , " dole said .
meanwhile , in los angeles , dole 's running mate , jack kemp , campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 los angeles riots .
kemp told a crowd of about 300 african americans in south central los angeles , " keep your eyes open , keep your ears open , keep your heart open .
i want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote . "
in dole 's address to a group that was largely white , the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the united states to missiles aimed at american children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use .
" they 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people , whether it 's a needle , whether it 's a cigarette , whatever the delivery system is -- it 's poison and it 's got to stop in america . "
he said .
dole said 70 percent of the cocaine that entered the united states and 40 percent of the marijuana came from mexico . "
we 've got an international problem and i 'm prepared to use our military might .
we want to stop drugs at the border , " he said .
dole 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes . "
i did n't say anything about cigarettes .
i was talking about drugs .
i said you should n't smoke either .
that 's all i said , " he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers .
when asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes , dole replied : " oh no .
come on , you know better than that . "
dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke .
dole also said he opposed california proposition 215 which , if approved by voters , would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses .
dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail .
in an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms , dole said three times during his 20-minute address that illegal drug use was neither a democratic nor a republican issue but one that involves all people .
the anti-drug message is a theme dole feels has strong voter appeal .
on sunday near chicago he accused president bill clinton of " raising the white flag " in the war on drugs .
a recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past four years .
dole was flanked by several california republican politicians including gov .
pete wilson , who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone .
" we need all the help we can get .
we need to get the kind of help we used to get when ronald reagan and george bush were in the white house , " wilson said .

cme lumber futures close lower on profit taking .
chicago 1996-08-28
profit taking continued to weigh on cme lumber futures but prices ended only slightly lower as strong cash markets underpinned futures , traders said .
the same pattern of the past few days persisted with futures declining early on the profit taking before firming late .
there was cash-related buying late from people who want to take delivery of the september contract , they said .
cash sources noted that although the cash market is generally quiet , prices remain firm on demand for prompt delivery wood , they added .
random lengths quoted cash spruce at $ 419 per tbf , up $ 5 from last friday and $ 7 over the last midweek quote .
reduced concern over hurricane edouard prompted some of the early profit taking .
expectations the storm would turn more to the north partly eased concerns , they said .
lumber closed $ 2.20 to $ 0.20 per tbf lower with september off $ 0.70 at $ 413.20 and november off most at $ 369.00 per tbf .

wheat--rains boost u.s. hrw planting prospects .
greg frost
kansas city , mo .
1996-08-28
above-normal summer rainfall in the u.s. high plains has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said wednesday .
from central texas north to kansas , rains throughout july and august have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year .
" our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said kim anderson , extension wheat marketing economist at oklahoma state university .
the irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on high plains wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " dust bowl " days of the 1930s .
" it 's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about october 1 it quit , " said mark hodges , executive director of the oklahoma wheat commission . "
hopefully that 's not going to happen this year . "
according to figures released by the oklahoma climatological survey , an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between march 1 and august 26 , 1996 .
that 's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period , according to howard johnson , associate state climatologist at the university of oklahoma .
he noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since july .
as an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between october 1 , 1995 and march 1 , 1996 , the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall .
in northern texas , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of oklahoma , said rodney mosier , executive assistant for the texas wheat producers .
" up here in the texas panhandle , we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " mosier said .
but he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern texas , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by hurricane dolly last week .
in kansas , typically the number one u.s. hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended sunday , according to the state 's agricultural statistics service .
in its weekly report released monday , the service said kansas topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , 77 percent adequate and 15 percent short to very short .
oklahoma 's agricultural statistics service showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , 81 percent adequate and 12 percent short to very short .
data on topsoil moisture ratings were not released by the texas agricultural statistics service .

first union national bank of fla. settles suit .
jacksonville , fla. 1996-08-28
first union national bank of florida said on wednesday it agreed to settle a class action law suit involving its collateral protection insurance ( cpi ) program .
to provide for the settlements , first union has established a common fund of $ 4.7 million for cash refunds and $ 19.4 million in credit refunds for outstanding cpi balances .
the bank is a division of first union corp .
the bank said most of the charges resulted from loan portfolios from banks and thrifts that were acquired in the 1980s .
first union said it has discontinued cpi as an element of its motor vehicle or boat installment loan contracts .
as part of the settlement agreement , customers who had cpi placed on loans from january 1 , 1986 to september 31 , 1996 , will receive cash or credit refunds , the bank said .
cash refunds will go to those who paid their loans to first union while credit refunds will go to those who have existing loan balances , the bank said .
amoco says in talks over yemen oil acreage .
new york 1996-08-28
amoco corp officials said the company is in talks over crude oil production sharing in yemen , but declined to comment on a published report amoco had reached preliminary agreement on a block in the shabwa area .
" we 've been asked ( by yemen ) not to comment ( on the talks ) , " said amoco spokesman dan dietsch . "
we can neither confirm nor deny that report , " he said .
according to middle east economic survey ( mees ) , yemen and amoco signed a " memorandum of understanding " for a production-sharing agreement in shabwa block no .
s-1 in the former south yemen , which united with north yemen in 1990 .
according to another amoco official , the company is not exploring now for oil anywhere in yemen .
the officials said amoco was deferring to the yemeni ministry of petroleum and minerals for any specific comments on the amoco-yemen talks .
the former soviet union was displaced as contractor of the potentially rich shabwa oilfields once it collapsed in december 1991 , according to the international petroleum encyclopedia .

burundi defends military regime to hostile un .
evelyn leopold
united nations 1996-08-28
burundi 's ambassador on wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by african states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government .
in a lengthy debate on burundi before the u.n. security council , ambassador nsanze terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former tanzanian president julius nyrere .
nearly every african member who spoke , as well as most security council members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of president pierre buyoya , an army major put in power in a july coup by the tutsi-run military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority hutus .
" these ( african ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of burundi , " terence said of the economic embargo . "
quite the contrary , burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow african people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of burundi . "
he said his government had just asked u.n. human rights monitors to increase their numbers in burundi in an effort " to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . "
more than 150,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority tutsis and the majority hutus since 1993 .
botswana 's envoy , mothusi nkgowe , said coups should be relegated " to the dump heap of history " as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government .
chile has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on burundi and call for negotiations .
the draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution .
among the council 's five permanent members , russia and the united states appeared to support most elements of the chilean proposal , while britain , france and china were cautious .
terence , a tutsi , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to " armed terroritsts . "
but chilean ambassador juan somavia said : " every weapon that reached burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian .
we must not send a signal different from the african leaders themselves .
inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action . "
burundi 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but terence told reporters buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in october .
the united states said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued .
ambassador karl inderfurth said the new government should have " unconditional " negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country .
he said washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider " an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . "
but he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring rwanda , where widespread genocide broke out against the tutsis two years ago .
he again said the united nations should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention .

anti-bhutto rally draws about 8,000 in karachi .
karachi , pakistan 1996-08-28
about 8,000 protesters marched through karachi on wednesday demanding the removal of pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto , witnesses said .
" from here we will march to islamabad and by god we will not let benazir and ( bhutto 's husband asif ali ) zardari escape justice , " nawaz sharif , leader of the main opposition pakistan muslim league told a rally organised by a 16-party alliance .
sharif accused bhutto of corruption and nepotism , charges she has denied in the past .
witnesses said protesters carrying colourful party flags walked for several miles , chanting anti-government slogans .
the event was part of an opposition campaign launched on august 14 , pakistan 's independence day .
sharif said similar rallies would be held in the balochistan provincial capital quetta and the punjab provincial capital lahore before an opposition march on the capital islamabad .
" i promise the people of karachi that those responsible for the extra-judicial killing of innocent youths would not be spared , " sharif said .
karachi 's ethnic mohajir national movement ( mqm ) accuses the government of killing many of its militants in cold blood .
the government has denied the charge and blames the mqm for much of the violence that killed 2,000 people in the city last year .
political observers said the turn-out was disappointing for a city of about 12 million people , possibly indicating that the mqm , although a member of the opposition alliance , had not mobilised its supporters for the event .
the turbulent southern port has been calmer this year , but police say more than 300 people have died in political unrest .
the mqm speaks for urdu-speaking moslems who migrated from india at partition in 1947 and their descendants .
sharif , a former prime minister , is the main political rival of bhutto , who defeated him in the october 1993 election .
he said only the removal of the government and an early election could save pakistan from disaster . "
we will dislodge the bhutto government .
it is a holy war for us , " he said .
bhutto has vowed to complete her five-year term .

bombay 1996-08-28
india 's leading cement firm associated cement companies ( acc ) said on wednesday its cement sales rose to 3.1 million tonnes in april-july 1996 from 2.93 million a year ago .
acc chairman nani palkhivala told shareholders at the firm 's annual meeting cement output rose to 3.14 million tonnes in the first quarter of 1996/97 ( april-march ) , from 3.01 million a year ago .
palkhivala said acc had secured government approval to take over a sick cement firm with a grinding capacity of 275,000 tonnes per year . "
we will take it over early next month , " he said .
talking about the cement industry in general , palkhivala said indian production rose by about 10 percent in 1995/96 .
" the industry saw capacity expansion of about 13 percent over 1994/95 from 77.79 million tonnes to 87.45 million tonnes , " palkhivala told shareholders .
he said indian cement exports dropped about eight percent from the previous year because of stiff international competition and inadequate infrastructural facilities .
acc 's own export performance was marginally better than in 1994/95 on account of a 36 percent rise in exports to nepal and the opening of a new market - sri lanka , he said .
despite power shortages , acc achieved a satisfactory growth in production during the year with the help of its power plants .
acc sold 9.4 million tonnes in 1995/96 , retaining its top position in the indian cement industry , palkhivala said .

india fishermen say forced to carry tamil refugees .

rameswaram , india 1996-08-28
indian fishermen said on wednesday they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in sri lanka to india , as a protest strike by more than 30,000 fishermen entered its ninth day .
" there is little we can do when at mid-sea .
the ltte ( liberation tigers of tamil eelam ) accosts us and , at the point of a gun , forces us to take refugees , " said senior fishermen leader p. arulanandam .
some 850 refugees have landed in recent weeks at the port of rameswaram in the southern indian state of tamil nadu , home to 50 million tamil-speaking people , port officials say .
rameswaram is 15 km ( 10 miles ) off the coast of sri lanka .
state chief minister m. karunanidhi has publicly welcomed the refugees , who are fleeing the 13-year war between tamil separatists and government troops that colombo says has cost 50,000 lives .
but the influx has triggered fears of a repeat of the 1980s when some 200,000 refugees landed in tamil nadu .
intelligence officals said more than 5,000 tamils were waiting on the western coast of sri lanka to cross into india .
the indian government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees .
the fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government 's cancellation of three trawlers ' fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying tamil refugees .
all fishermen 's association secretary n.j. bose said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met .
" until the government releases our boats from naval custody and sri lankan naval custody , and gives us assurance ( it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees ) , we will not call off our strike , " bose said .
ltte spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but sri lankan fishermen denied that indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the palk strait .
" indian fishermen come right up to pesalai to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige .
only some take money , " sri lankan boatman chinnathambi said .
arulanandam denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to india and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival .
" we have not gone to sea since august 19 , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless .
how could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? "
he said .
an indian fisheries department official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between india and sri lanka , but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of sri lanka 's pomfret-rich waters .

miltiadis evert heads to alexandroupolis this weekend .
athens 1996-08-28
conservative new democracy ( nd ) party leader miltiadis evert will be hitting the campaign trail and head to alexandroupolis this weekend to speak to the city 's businessmen on sunday morning , nd said .
evert will depart for alexandroupolis on saturday afternoon .
prime minister costas simitis criticized evert today for unleashing a seven-point economic package that offers tax relief to merchants and other professionals , higher pensions to farmers and support for small business .
the finance ministry estimated the cost of nd 's economic measures to over 600 billion drachmas but nd officials put the figure much lower to about 300 billion drachmas .
simitis blamed nd for the low absorption rate of eu funds and said the socialists will increase farmers ' pensions , combat tax evasion and accelerate gdp growth rates to 4.0 percent in a few years .
faster economic growth is a major component of nd 's economic programme and evert has repeatedly blamed the socialists for the slow economic growth .

dow pushes london stocks to new record .

london 1996-08-28
a firm start on wall street helped push leading london shares to a new record high on wednesday and german stocks closed floor trading up but the paris bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest .
on the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .
london shares , boosted by wall street , added to early gains with the blue chip ftse 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly .
one focus was british airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of " open skies " talks between the u.s. transportation department and the british government may jeopardise its tie-up with american airlines .
the conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the u.s .
better-than-expected british trade figures had little impact on equities .
the non-eu july trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while june 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds .
forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling .
german shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar .
the 30-share dax index closed at 2,563.16 points , up 4.32 .
however , french stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main cac-40 index .
dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes
louis viannet , leader of france 's communist-led cgt union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on wednesday and warned of labour unrest as france gets back to work after the holidays .
later in the day , helped by the firmer wall street opening , paris climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory .
in foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the european afternoon , up from its european close on tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs .
it had been boosted overnight by the bank of japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or " tankan " , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment .
the unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen .
the japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .
the boj sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year .
a boj spokesman said " the doors to the recovery have not been shut ...
the recovery is still continuing . "
these remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further .
" the dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , " said currency economist klaus baader .
dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected june industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .

arafat says israel declares war on palestinians .
wafa amr
ramallah , west bank 1996-08-28
palestinian president yasser arafat said on wednesday that israel had declared war on the palestinians and called for the first general strike in the west bank and gaza in two years .
" what happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the palestinian people , " arafat told the palestinian legislature .
accusing israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of stupidity , arafat launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in may .
the tirade was sparked by israel 's announcement on tuesday of plans to expand the jewish settlement of kiryat sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in arab east jerusalem .
" israel has started the war on jerusalem .
they are idiots to have started the jerusalem battle , " arafat said in arabic . "
there will be no palestinian state without jerusalem .
netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle . "
arafat called for a general strike " for jerusalem " on thursday in all of the west bank and gaza strip .
there has not been a joint shutdown there since may 1994 when israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 1993 .
the strike will have little effect on the israeli economy while hurting palestinian merchants in east jerusalem and bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade .
some 25,000 palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in israel .
but palestinians , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from romania and china .
" on friday , all moslems , including palestinians in israel ...
will go to ( jerusalem 's ) al-aqsa mosque and pray .
jews and christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , " arafat said .
officials in netanyahu 's office were not immediately available for comment on arafat 's remarks .
israeli travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by moslem militants in february and march , ban most of the two million arabs in the west bank and gaza from entering jerusalem .
netanyahu , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign , accusing labour prime minister shimon peres of planning to hand control of the arab eastern part of the city to the palestinians .
israel captured east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war and claims both halves of the city as its capital .
the plo wants east jerusalem as the capital of a future palestinian state .
in his speech to the crowded legislature , arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although " alarm bells are ringing " .
he unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from u.s. middle east envoy dennis ross , who held talks in paris on tuesday with israeli and egyptian officials .
when arafat returned to the podium , he said senior plo negotiator mahmoud abbas , better known as abu mazen , and netanyahu aide dore gold could meet on thursday .
he quoted ross as telling him : " the important thing is the israelis are prepared to move . "
arafat said he replied : " is this like their previous promises ? "
" no , they have good intentions , " arafat quoted ross as saying .
palestinians have been pressing israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint west bank city of hebron agreed by the previous labour government .
the israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by defence minister yitzhak mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in hebron .

turkey says 25 kurd rebels killed in clashes .

us investors mull appeal of lloyd 's decision .
patricia vowinkel
new york 1996-08-27
u.s. investors in troubled lloyd 's of london were considering late on tuesday whether to appeal a u.s. court decision in favour of lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions .
a u.s. appeals court on tuesday gave lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse .
a lower court issued the injunction on friday and ordered lloyd 's to give investors , known as names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan .
" my prediction is that the names will appeal , " said kenneth chiate , a u.s. name and a chief negotiator for the american names association .
" at this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that i 'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . "
but to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is . "
under the reorganisation plan , lloyd 's plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called equitas .
the arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund equitas but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities .
the names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 gmt wednesday , but lloyd 's chairman david rowland said on tuesday the offer would be extended .
at least eight u.s. states have still some form of litigation pending , said john head , spokesman for the association of lloyd 's state chairmen , a group representing u.s. names .
" it goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed , " head said of the decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the fourth circuit , sitting in baltimore .
but , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . "
the colorado attorney general told lloyd 's last week it was considering a new legal action against the british insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud .
" we have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said colorado attorney general gale norton .
norton said she was concerned that the lloyd 's agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of colorado .
in addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities .
meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 names in california is still pending before the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit , chiate of the american names association said .
that lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a u.s. district court .
that case " is what i call the most significant alternate remedy for us , " chiate said .
the individual names , however , now must decide whether to accept lloyd 's settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation .
chiate said he has advised names that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . "
rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing lloyd 's two to three times more than lloyd 's is now willing to accept , he said .
but , in rejecting the offer , the names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said .
german police made nazi gestures , officials say .
nuremberg , germany 1996-08-28
german riot police made nazi gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions , the bavarian interior ministry said on wednesday .
the ministry declined to detail gestures the nuremberg-based policemen had made at the august 13 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry .
a spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city , where dictator adolf hitler held some of his most infamous nazi party rallies in the 1930s , said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public .

a motorist threatened a fellow driver with a starting pistol as he overtook him illegally in the inside lane on a motorway near berlin and was photographed in the act by the driver 's wife , prosecutors said on wednesday .
prosecutors in the city of potsdam said the 32-year-old man drew alongside the other car at about 110 kph ( 70 mph ) and aimed his pistol at the driver .
but the driver 's wife kept her nerve , got out her camera and photographed him .
the man has been charged with dangerous driving , coercion and threatening behaviour .
german prosecutors file sex tourism charges .
berlin 1996-08-28
berlin prosecutors said on wednesday they had filed charges against two german men for sexually abusing children in thailand and distributing pornographic films and pictures of their degrading acts .
the case is one of only a handful in which authorities have managed to track down suspects under a law which lets them pursue germans who commit sex offences abroad .
the pair , identified only as 43-year-old clerk dieter u and businessman thomas s , 33 , are alleged to have carried out acts of sexual indecency with children as young as 10 years old between 1994 and 1995 .
their videos included pictures of one of the accused tying up a thai boy and performing acts of sadistic torture on him , prosecutors said in a statement .
in another scene , a young girl performed oral sex with an unidentified adult man .
the new law was introduced with much fanfare in 1993 .
but prosecutors face huge difficulties in gathering evidence and bringing witnesses to testify in a german court , and only one person has so far been convicted under the law .
investigators are probing several other cases .
the berlin prosecutors said they had been alerted to the two men by customs officials who intercepted packages containing pornographic photographs and order forms .

stephanie of monaco 's husband snapped cavorting .
rome 1996-08-28
two italian magazines published pictures on wednesday of daniel ducruet , princess stephanie of monaco 's husband and former bodyguard , cavorting naked with another woman by a poolside in france .
the magazines , eva tremila and its sister publication gente , printed up to 26 pages of photos of the woman undressing ducruet , the pair embracing on a sunbed and finally both naked .
eva tremila said other even more explicit photos were taken but it did not print them .
the magazines named the woman as fili houteman , a 26-year-old french singer and dancer in a belgian cabaret club .
the photographs , an italian exclusive , raised eyebrows in the tiny principality , where stephanie 's father prince rainier , had long disapproved of his daughter 's choice of husband .
stephanie had two children with ducruet before their marriage in july last year .
stephanie , caroline and albert are the children of rainier and former hollywood screen goddess grace kelly , who was killed in a car crash in 1982 .
" we have seen the photos but for the moment the palace has no comment , " a spokeswoman for prince rainier told reuters .
the magazines said the photographs were taken in cap de villefranche , some 15 km ( nine miles ) from monte carlo .
gente said ducruet , a keen racing driver , met houteman during a race in belgium and photographers had been on their trail ever since .
the magazine said video cameras had also been used to film the couple and that a sound-track existed .

spanish tomato warriors paint the town red .
bunol , spain 1996-08-28
revellers painted the town red on wednesday as the 1996 edition of the world 's biggest tomato fight began in the eastern spanish village of bunol .
thousands of people pelted each other with armfuls of ripe tomatoes as streets , walls and windows were coated in a blood-red wash .
a single firework after midday signalled the start of the fruit-throwing frenzy , during which participants hurl some 100 tonnes of tomatoes trucked in for the occasion .
local historians say the tradition began in 1945 when disgruntled locals began spontaneously to bombard the priest and mayor at the annual fiesta in bunol ( pronounced boo-nee-ol ) .
the festival 's fame has grown and now attracts between 15,000 and 20,000 people , many of them foreigners .

rtrs - guinness peat expects strong full yr .
sydney 1996-08-28
british-based investment company guinness peat group plc ( gpg ) said on wednesday it expected a strong full year result .
" we think we 're in a position to produce a strong result , however a lot of our profitability must inevitably depend on a number of ( company ) results , " said gpg director garry weiss .
gpg earlier said its net profit for the six months to june 30 rose to 9.77 million pounds from 6.93 million in the previous first half .
the company did not declare an interim dividend as in the previous year .
weiss said the australian share market had been somewhat negative for much of 1996 and this had some effect on the company 's first half results .
" however , it certainly is a very pleasing result for the first six months , " he said .
weiss said most of the company 's half year earning stemmed from the sale of its 50 percent stake in physicians insurance co of ohio .
he said the company decided to sell its u.s. investment in order to consolidate investments closer to its administrative base .
gpg said its stakes in tyndall australia ltd and mid-east minerals ltd both contributed strongly to gpg 's first half earnings .

khmer rouge 's ieng sary confirms break with pol pot .
aranyaprathet , thailand 1996-08-28
dissident khmer rouge leader ieng sary confirmed on wednesday that he had broken with pol pot and other hardliners of the guerrilla group and had formed a rival movement .
ieng sary said in a written statement , the first since his split with pol pot earlier this month , that the new movement to be called the democratic national united movement ( dnum ) would seek an end to civil war and work towards reconciliation with the cambodian government .
" i would like to inform you about my decision to break away from pol pot , ta mok , son sen 's dictatorial group , " he said in a copy of the statement obtained by reuters .
" we believe that our country will be reduced to nothing if the khmer people continue to fight against each other indefinitely ....
for this reason we decided to break away from that dictatorial group and found a movement named ' democratic national united movement ' , " he said .
ieng sary was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the mass genocide in cambodia during the khmer rouge rule of terror between 1975-1979 when over a million people were executed or died of starvation , disease or overwork in mass labour camps .
the french-educated , former brother-in-law of pol pot was foreign minister in the khmer rouge government that ruled cambodia and was seen as the group 's second in command .

mof 's kubo says believes boj rate policy unchanged .
tokyo 1996-08-28
japan 's finance minister wataru kubo told a news conference on wednesday that he believes that the bank of japan 's ( boj ) interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank 's " tankan " survey .
the boj released the august tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened .
however , kubo said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy .
" the question is what the boj is going to do with its interest rate policy .
the boj governor has made it clear that the boj 's policy is aimed at ensuring basis for economic recovery .
i believe this policy has not changed , " he said .
asked if a supplementary budget for 1996/97 was needed to support the economy , kubo said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget .
" i do n't think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged , " kubo said . "
the economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace . "
kubo said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-september of japan 's gross domestic product for the april-june quarter .
" i would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of 1996 , " he said .
china says militant japan must face war past .
beijing 1996-08-28
china on wednesday called on japan to acknowledge its wartime past and put a stop to a tide of resurgent militarism to prevent similar atrocities in future .
" some japanese are still unrepentant about the atrocities committed by the japanese militarists during the war , " said a commentary in the official china daily .
" if they are still undecided whether the war japan launched was aggressive in nature , it will be difficult to tell whether they will do the same again , " the newspaper said .
china raised indignant protests after several japanese cabinet ministers visited a shrine dedicated to their country 's war dead on august 15 , the 51st anniversary of japan 's world war two surrender .
" numerous japanese politicians have tried to whitewash their country 's war atrocities in recent years , " the commentary said .
china estimates 35 million chinese were killed or wounded by invading japanese troops from 1931 to 1945 .
" the japanese have never genuinely apologised for their wartime crimes , " the commentary said .
japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto marked the august 15 anniversary by expressing " remorse " for foreign victims of japan 's world war two atrocities .
japan coalition party leader plans to resign .
tokyo 1996-08-28
the leader of a junior partner in japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on wednesday .
the officials said new party sakigake president masayoshi takemura , finance minister until the beginning of this year , promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member .
they said the date of takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials .
the sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , prime minister ryutaro hashimoto 's liberal democratic party ( ldp ) , the biggest grouping , and the social democratic party .
but analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election .
the dispute pits takemura , who founded sakigake in 1993 as a reform-oriented ldp splinter group , against party official yukio hatoyama , who says he will leave sakigake to form a reformist political group next month .
hatoyama , the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister , on tuesday quit as sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old takemura , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force .
marathon talks between the two former allies on tuesday night and wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of takemura , seen by hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the ldp-dominated coalition .
the presence of takemura , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said .
media reports say that at most 10 of 23 sakigake members , joined by a handful of social democrats , will follow hatoyama when he bolts -- far short of the 50 lawmakers needed to topple hashimoto 's eight-month-old government .
hashimoto -- who returns from a 10-day latin american tour on saturday -- must call polls by mid-1997 , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election .
but many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early october .

hong kong 1996-08-28
with 307 days to go before the british colony reverts to china , the hong kong media focused mainly on domestic issues concerning alleged pressure on a judge , cross straights relations and the democratic lobby 's relationship with beijing .
the beijing-funded wen wei po said taiwan 's government could not hope to stem the island 's economic and trade exchanges with china .
the paper said that using administrative power to limit economic activities across the taiwan strait would not work .
ming pao daily news said it hoped chinese officials would soon open dialogue with hong kong 's democratic party and the newly-established democracy lobby , frontier , in order to ease anxieties in the lead-up to the handover .
the english language south china morning post said the judiciary needed to take swift and decisive action in investigating the allegations that a judge had been subjected to pressure in a new zealand immigration case involving allegations of fraud .
the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law were of paramount importance to hong kong 's survival as a business centre .
the chinese language daily hong kong economic times said the legal department had been indecisive in its handling of the judge 's case .
such hesitancy on the part of the government had damaged public confidence in the rule of law , the paper said .

palestinian authority frees rights activist .
gaza 1996-08-28
a human rights activist said on wednesday he had been released after more than two weeks in detention that followed his call for an inquiry into the death of a gaza man interrogated by palestinian police .
mohammad dahman , director of the gaza-based addameer prisoners support association , said he was freed on tuesday without being charged .
palestinian attorney-general khaled al-qidra was not immediately available to comment .
qidra had said dahman was arrested on suspicion of making a false statement .
the activist was detained by palestinian intelligence service agents on august 12 after publishing a statement demanding an investigation into the death of a gaza man who had been questioned by palestinian authorities .
the palestinian authority said the dead man , nahed dahlan , had committed suicide .
human rights groups had protested about dahman 's arrest in letters to palestinian president yasser arafat and to qidra .

iran asks bonn to extradite ex-president banisadr .
bonn 1996-08-28
iran has asked germany to extradite its former president abolhassan banisadr for alleged hijacking , an iranian embassy spokesman said on wednesday .
banisadr angered tehran last week by accusing top iranian leaders of ordering the assassination of iranian kurdish leaders in a berlin restaurant in 1992 .
he made the allegations at the trial of an iranian and four lebanese accused of carrying out the attack .
an iranian embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that iran had formally requested banisadr 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee iran in july 1981 .
" we submitted the request three or four days ago , " he said .
german authorities could not immediately be reached for comment .
banisadr lives under round-the-clock security in france , fearing tehran could make an attempt on his life .
he is due back in berlin on september 5 to continue his testimony , which has backed up german prosecutors ' allegations that tehran ordered the attack on the exiled leaders .
three dissidents and their translator were killed in the gangland-style machinegun attack .
iran has warned germany that bilateral relations could suffer if it pays heed to the testimony of banisadr , an architect of iran 's islamic revolution who has been a sworn enemy of tehran since he fell from favour after a year as president .

iss says agreed sale of u.s. unit .
copenhagen 1996-08-28
danish cleaning group iss on wednesday said it had signed a letter of intent to sell its troubled u.s unit iss inc to canadian firm aaxis limited .
an iss statement said that aaxis , with year-end 1996 assets of us$ 10.9 million and equity of $ 10.5 million , would be listed on the montreal stock exchange , but did not say when .
it said that under the sale agreement , full financial details of which were not revealed , iss would acquire a 25 percent stake in aaxis which would become an associated company within the iss group trading under the iss name and logo .
iss inc senior management would continue to run the business under the new owners , it said .
danish analysts recently estimated iss inc 's sale value at up to $ 118 million .
iss said that the deal included iss inc operations in mexico and the sale of iss inc interests in brazil would be discussed .
on august 15 , iss published first half 1996 results showing a two billion crown loss caused by falsified accounts in iss inc and said that charges and provisions earlier estimated at $ 100 million would have to be increased to $ 146 million .
it also wrote down all iss inc goodwill and wednesday 's statement said that the aaxis purchase would not necessitate further write down if the sale were completed according to the terms of the letter of intent .

iraq balks at u.n. staff for oil-for-food deal .
evelyn leopold
united nations 1996-08-28
iraq has balked at the number of u.n. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the united states for insisting on stringent monitoring .
in comments to reporters and a statement on tuesday , iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which baghdad has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture .
at issue was a may 20 agreement allowing iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded kuwait in august 1990 .
the iraqi statement said the united states was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . "
iraq 's deputy ambassador , saeed hasan , noted that the may 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the united nations and that the government of iraq would be consulted .
saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the u.n. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after secretary-general boutros boutros-ghali reports that arrangements are in place .
the u.n. department of humanitarian affairs ( dha ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the united states .
according to u.n. officials and diplomats , iraq would have about $ 1.13 billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for gulf war victims and costs for u.n. weapons inspections were deducted .
the cost of the u.n. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 31 million .
in addition another $ 12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs .
for the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the united nations estimated it needed 1,190 people , including 267 international staff and 923 iraqi support staff .
of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the baghdad government .
another 203 international staff and 325 iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country .
there are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows , 32 customs experts and four new york-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts .
yasushi akashi , the dha undersecretary-general , told the security council last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total ...
roughly 3 percent . "

eu commission cool on changing beef cull plan .
brussels 1996-08-29
the european commission said on thursday it would study scientific reports saying britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .
" obviously we are interested in this research .
we will ask the ( eu ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " commission spokesman gerard kiely told reuters .
but he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by britain and its 14 eu partners .
" we agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of bse cases possible .
i think it would be very difficult to sell to the european commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer bse cases , " kiely said .
" we will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said .
" we have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue .
the issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of bse , " he added .
the reaction is likely to disappoint british farmers , who seized on research by oxford scientists in the scientific journal nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle .
the researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of bse before 2001 .
british farmers ' leader called on wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report .
" i hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , " national farmers union president sir david naish told bbc radio .
naish said there was no need for britain to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its european partners .
" the new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout europe accepted this evidence , " naish said .
the report could well reopen a damaging row between britain and the eu , which slapped a worldwide ban on british beef after the government said there could be a link between bse and the human form of the disease .
the issue flared in in march when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with creutzfeldt-jakob disease ( cjd ) from eating bse-infected beef .
french farmers set up blockades in mad cow protest .
paris 1996-08-29
thousands of farmers threw up roadblocks across france overnight , stopping and checking lorries suspected of importing meat from outside the european union , french radios reported on thursday .
radio stations said around 15,000 farmers , angered by a fall in beef prices following the mad cow disease crisis , staged protests in many areas and blockaded several main roads and motorways .
by 3 a.m. ( 0100 gmt ) more than 2,000 lorries had been stopped and searched .
european beef sales plunged after britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) , or mad cow disease , and its fatal human equivalent creutzfeldt-jakob disease ( cjd ) .

cricket - croft restricts pakistan to 225-5 .
manchester , england 1996-08-29
tight bowling from glamorgan off-spinner robert croft helped england to restrict pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at old trafford on thursday .
croft , who was one of the few englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at the oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of aamir sohail and wasim akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 .
there was also a wicket each for ronnie irani , allan mullally and darren gough although there was no joy for dean headley who , along with lancashire batsman graham lloyd , was making his international debut .
after wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , pakistani made an excellent start as sohail and saeed anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 .
anwar , who struck a superb 176 at the oval , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off irani to mullally at long-on .
sohail and ijaz ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before england struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs .
first , sohail , after making 48 , was bowled by croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side .
wasim , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs .
shortly after ijaz was also back in the pavilion for 48 after irani had repaid mullally with another good catch at long-on .
gough later bowled moin khan with an inswinging yorker but inzamam-ul-haq , 37 not out , and salim malik took pakistan to 225 for five when the overs ran out .

baseball - yankees brawl and continue to slide .
seattle 1996-08-29
jay buhner hit a three-run homer and former yankee terry mulholland allowed one run over seven innings as the seattle mariners completed a sweep of new york with a 10-2 victory in a game marred by a bench-clearing brawl .
including the last three games of last october 's divisional playoff series , the mariners have beaten the yankees 12 of the past 15 meetings overall and 14 of the last 16 in the kingdome .
five players were ejected after yankees ' outfielder paul o'neill and seattle catcher john marzano got into a fight after o'neill had been brushed back .
in baltimore , don wengert threw a nine-hitter for his first shutout and jose herrera had a two-run double in a three-run fifth inning as the oakland athletics blanked the baltimore orioles 3-0 .
wengert ( 7-9 ) , who failed to record a shutout in his previous 86 starts in either the minors or majors , did not walk a batter and struck out three for oakland .
in chicago , james baldwin scattered five hits over seven scoreless innings and ray durham and ozzie guillen had rbi hits in the second inning as the chicago white sox blanked the milwaukee brewers 2-0 .
baldwin ( 10-4 ) struck out four and did not walk a batter for chicago , which won for only the fourth time in 15 games .
dave nilsson had three hits for the brewers .
in kansas city , jose offerman 's single with two out in the 12th inning scored johnny damon with the winning run and lifted the kansas city royals to a 4-3 victory over the texas rangers .
rick huisman ( 1-1 ) allowed one hit and a walk in the 12th to post his first major-league win .
in toronto , pat hentgen tossed a five-hitter for his fifth consecutive complete game and three players drove in two runs apiece as the toronto blue jays defeated the minnesota twins 6-1 for their ninth win in 11 games .
hentgen ( 17-7 ) surrendered just three doubles and a pair of singles in tossing his major-league leading ninth complete game .
he walked three and struck out three in winning for the 10th time in his last 11 decisions .
in detroit , orel hershiser recorded his fourth straight win and albert belle snapped a sixth-inning tie with a grand slam as the cleveland indians completed a season sweep of the detroit tigers with a 9-3 victory .
hershiser ( 14-7 ) , who allowed three runs , eight hits and one walk with five strikeouts over seven innings , improved to 4-0 in his last six starts , including a pair of wins over detroit in the last 11 days .

tennis - martinez gets aggressive at u.s. open .
larry fine
new york 1996-08-28
conchita martinez decided that when in new york , do as the new yorkers do -- and the spaniard 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the u.s. open .
the fourth-seeded spaniard , who is tackling the world class traffic of new york city as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over france 's nathalie tauziat 6-1 6-3 on wednesday to take her place in the third round .
" i 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , " said the 24-year-old martinez after crushing tauziat in just over an hour .
" what i 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like i did tonight .
that would really help . "
martinez , the 1994 wimbledon champion , used to struggle at the open , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos .
" there is a lot of things that can happen , " martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at flushing meadows .
" like traffic .
we stay in manhattan and it 's a long way to come .
the crowds , they speak louder or they move .
that does n't happen in other grand slams .
that 's where the real champion wins .
you have to concentrate for these two weeks . "
it took martinez four opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that .
last year , martinez , who finished 1995 ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to monica seles .
now she feels she is in the swing of things .
" i have my own car now and that helps , " said martinez .
" sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up .
this time it did n't happen .
i do the driving and i love it .
it gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers .
" we change lanes all the time in barcelona .
i 'm used to it and i like to drive fast . "
baseball - braves sign neagle .
atlanta 1996-08-28
the defending world champion atlanta braves , with the best record and best pitching in baseball , added another weapon wednesday , acquiring denny neagle , the winningest left-hander in the national league , from the pittsburgh pirates .
the pirates , who conceded earlier this week they would be forced to trim salary from next season 's payroll , received ron wright , a first baseman at double-a greenville ; corey pointer , a pitcher at class-a eugene , and a player to be named .
it was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the braves , who already have an 11-game lead in the national league eastern division .
in the last 15 days , atlanta has traded for third baseman terry pendleton , claimed outfielder luis polonia on waivers and called up minor-league phenom andruw jones , all in preparation for their fifth post-season .

athletics - johnson , christie , bailey to run owens relay .
adrian warner
berlin 1996-08-29
olympic champions michael johnson and donovan bailey and former champion linford christie will run in a " dream team " sprint relay squad in honour of jesse owens on friday .
johnson , the 200 metres world record holder , and britain 's 1992 olympic 100 champion christie confirmed on thursday that they would join 100 record holder bailey and namibia 's frankie fredericks in one of the greatest 4x100 squads ever assembled .
they will run against quartets from the united states , europe and africa in a special race at the berlin grand prix meeting to mark the 60th anniversary of owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 olympics in the german capital .
christie will run the anchor leg after canada 's bailey , american johnson and olympic silver medallist fredericks have run the first three stages of the relay .
the participation of bailey and fredericks had been known before thursday .
but christie did not announce his decision to run until the eve of the meeting when organisers also confirmed johnson would take part .
christie is due to retire from international competition at the end of the season although he may compete for britain in next season 's european cup .
although christie , who is not racing the individual 100 metres in berlin , took his time to agree to run , the veteran was clearly delighted to be part of the tribute to the black american .
when five former olympic 100 champions from 1948 to 1980 , who have been invited to watch the race , turned up at a news conference on thursday , christie was quick to put his autograph book in front of the them .
" i do n't normally do this but can you please sign , " he said thrusting an ornate white book in front of americans harrison dillard ( 1948 ) , lindy remigino ( 1952 ) , jim hines ( 1968 ) , trinidad 's hasely crawford ( 1976 ) and britain 's allan wells ( 1980 ) .
" jesse owens inspired everyone here and it is great to have a tribute to him . "
owens 's widow ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out by the sprinter 's grand-daughter gina tillman during the meeting
berlin organisers hoped to have american 1984 and 1988 champion carl lewis in the squad but he injured himself in last friday 's brussels meeting .
soccer - genoa awarded italian cup win .
milan 1996-08-29
italian soccer 's sports judge on thursday ruled that genoa , beaten 3-0 by lecce in the first round of the italian cup , should be awarded a 2-0 victory because their opponents fielded a banned player .
the ruling meant that serie b club genoa now meet local serie a arch-rivals sampdoria in the second round .
genoa appealed after their defeat last saturday on the grounds that lecce striker jonathan bachini , who came on in the 71st minute with his team leading 2-0 , still had a one-match suspension to serve from last season .
soccer - nice sack coach emon .
nice , france 1996-08-29
struggling french first division side nice on thursday announced they were parting with coach albert emon after a string of poor results .
club president andre bois said a successor would be named on friday .
a former player for marseille and monaco , emon , 43 , has coached nice since 1992 .
the announcement came 24 hours after the team from the french riviera lost at home to guingamp 2-1 in a league match .
nice are 18th in the table .
soccer - three pull out of dutch squad for brazil .
amsterdam 1996-08-29
three dutch players have pulled out of the squad for saturday 's friendly international soccer match against brazil in amsterdam .
ajax defender john veldman and his team mate richard witschge are injured , while psv midfielder philip cocu has a fever .
dutch coach guus hiddink called in feyenoord midfielder giovanni van bronckhorst and vitesse defender ferdy vierklau for cocu and veldman , but did not name a replacement for midfielder witschge .
britain welcomes romania-hungary treaty accord .
bucharest 1996-08-29

zaire installs first election delegates .
kinshasa 1996-08-29
a total of 116 delegates to zaire 's national election commission ( cne ) were formally installed on thursday , launching another phase of the central african nation 's much-delayed democratic transition .
the 116 , representing political parties in the capital kinshasa , will help organise a voter census , a constitutional referendum planned for january and efforts to brief potential voters on what balloting involves .
a total of 9,446 delegates will be deployed throughout zaire 's 11 provinces for the elections , which must be held by july 1997 under the transitional constitution .
presidential , parliamentary and municipal elections are planned for may .
" we can meet the required deadlines for organising the elections .
all that is needed is for everyone to show goodwill , " commission spokesman yoka lye mudaba told reporters .
delegates to the commission from the other 10 provinces will be installed progressively from next week with the provinces of north and south kivu , maniema , shaba and bandundu having priority , he said .
the installation of delegates was initially scheduled for july .
officials said lack of funding had delayed the process .
president mobutu sese seko , who seized power in a 1965 coup , introduced a multi-party system in 1990 but zaire 's transition has lagged well behind that of other states in the region .
in the past , mobutu has been elected without opposition .
nigeria would not refuse commonwealth officials .
lagos 1996-08-29
nigeria would not object to a visit by commonwealth officials but insists its suspension from the organisation be resolved before any other questions are addressed , foreign minister tom ikimi said on thursday .
ikimi reiterated his position that the commonwealth had no mandate to send a fact-finding mission .
" the request i have received is for their officials to come and talk to my officials .
we cannot object to people wanting to visit nigeria , " ikimi told reuters by telephone from the capital abuja .
" the fundamental problem we have with the commonwealth is our unfair suspension .
any discussions we have at ministerial level will be a continuation of what we began in london on that .
before that is accomplished we cannot address anything else . "
nigeria was suspended from the commonwealth in november after the execution of ken saro-wiwa and eight other minority rights activists in defiance of international pleas for clemency .
a meeting of commonwealth ministers in london on wednesday said it planned to send a team of senior officials to nigeria as soon as possible to persuade abuja to accept a fact-finding mission .
the timing of that mission has yet to be determined .
the latest diplomatic row between nigeria 's military government and the club of britain and its former colonies erupted over the terms of a visit by commonwealth ministers to discuss nigeria 's suspension .
nigeria said they would be restricted to a two-day meeting with government officials , but the commonwealth said it wanted to hold meetings with people outside the government and called off the visit .

nato releases serb police , crisis easing - nato .
sarajevo 1996-08-29
nato forces released a group of bosnian serb policemen late on thursday and a tense confrontation appeared to be easing , an alliance spokesman said .
" the situation in mahala seems to be very much on its way toward resolution .
my understanding is the ( serb ) police have been released ...
in zvornik , we think the situation is winding down as well , " nato spokesman lieutenant colonel max marriner told reuters .
nato troops detained 65 bosnian serb policemen early on thursday after they attacked moslem refugees returning to homes in mahala , a serb-controlled village on bosnia 's internal boundary line .
in apparent retaliation for nato 's detention of the serbs , an angry serb mob including policemen trapped six unarmed u.n. police monitors and three local aides in their office in the town of zvornik , east of mahala .
marriner said nato forces confiscated 25 long-barreled ak-47 automatic assault rifles from the detained serbs before setting them free .
" local radio and television there ( in zvornik ) are advising people to step back and take it easy .
we think that when the word about how things are going in mahala which is about 35 minutes away by road reaches zvornik that should help , " marriner said .

kornblum , milosevic discuss election crisis .
peter greste
belgrade 1996-08-29
u.s. envoy john kornblum met serbian president slobodan milosevic on thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding bosnia 's post-war elections .
the american diplomat arrived in belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of serb refugee voters .
" we discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and i made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the republika srpska ( bosnian serb republic ) which led to this development , " kornblum said after three hours of talks .
but he said the united states still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in bosnia as scheduled on september 14 to bolster the peace process .
kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from milosevic , the patron of the bosnian serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process .
bosnia 's moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved .
human rights workers say serbian and bosnian serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in serb-held territory in bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest .
serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the bosnian serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing .
kornblum said only elections endorsed by the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) would be legitimate .
" as we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . "
the elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the osce . "
after meeting milosevic , kornblum flew to the croatian capital zagreb .
he was due to head to the bosnian town of banja luka on friday to meet bosnian serb acting president biljana plavsic and bosnian serb opposition leaders .
he also planned to travel to sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist croat mini-state in western bosnia .
u.n. police , relief workers and nato officers have reported a rise in political violence across bosnia in the run-up to the september 14 elections .
voters will be choosing a three-member presidency and a parliament to rule over a loose union of bosnia , comprised of a serb republic and a moslem-croat federation .
gazprom rises to 2,901.48 rbls at auction .
moscow 1996-08-29
a stake of 10 million shares in russian gas monopoly rao gazprom was sold at auction on thursday at an average 2,901.48 roubles a share , up from 2,891.00 roubles a week ago , the federal securities corporation ( ffk ) said .
starting price at the auction was 2,746 roubles a share and the 40 lots sold for between 2,840 and 2,998 roubles a share , the ffk said in a statement .
the stake represented 0.042 percent of gazprom 's capital .
the ffk said that since auctions began , 139.75 million shares , equivalent to 0.59 percent of gazprom , have changed hands .
gazprom , russia 's biggest company by market capitalisation , has massive reserves and potentially huge earnings .
however , its 23.6 billion shares are highly illiquid and management permission is required to sell them .
gazprom has recently tightened these rules , making it harder for shareholders to sell to whoever they want , when they want .
the company has organised regular auctions of its shares to create an orderly market in the paper .
at the first auction on march 6 , shares sold for an average 406.6 roubles each , and prices have been rising steadily since then , but the rise in price this week and last was much less than in previous auctions .
on the russian trading system , gazprom shares rose 25 percent on thursday to $ 0.375 from $ 0.300 , after falling by over a third earlier this week .

serbian policeman shot dead in kosovo province .
belgrade 1996-08-29
a policeman has been shot dead in serbia 's troubled kosovo province , serbian police said on thursday .
it was the fifth attack on police this month in the southern province , a hot spot of ethnic tension where the albanian majority have boycotted serbian institutions and set up their own , which are considered illegal by belgrade .
the slain policeman ejup bajgora , 42 , was an albanian who had served in the serbian police and state security since 1987 , police told the yugoslav news agency tanjug .
he was shot on wednesday afternoon as he stepped off a bus near his family home in the village of donje ljupce in the municipality of podujevo .
just hours before wednesday 's shooting , three hand grenades were thrown at a police station in celopek .
they caused damage but no casualties , police said .
the serbian authorities blame albanian dissidents for the recent spate of attacks .
none of the attackers has been caught .
kosovo 's autonomy was revoked in 1987 and serb police forces cracked down on albanian protests .
albanian moderates want autonomy restored but hardliners want to join up with neighbouring albania .
the serbs , who make up 10 percent of the province 's 1.8 million people , claim kosovo as the cradle of their culture .

buenos aires fraud cops held in extortion racket .
buenos aires , argentina 1996-08-29
thirteen senior police officers from the fraud squad of buenos aires province have been arrested on charges of running an extortion racket , security officials said on thursday .
they included all the top officers from the fraud division of the north of buenos aires province , including commissioner juan carlos lago .
police were seeking a 14th officer .
la nacion newspaper said the officers were suspected of demanding bribes of $ 50,000 to $ 500,000 from companies being investigated for tax evasion in order to " lose " their files .
the credibility of the buenos aires provincial police , the largest force in argentina , has been undermined this year by scandals that included the indictment of three officers for links to the 1994 bombing of a jewish community centre and the arrest of an entire drugs squad for drug trafficking .
alberto piotti , security chief of buenos aires province , told local television that 3,600 dishonest officers had been purged from the force 's ranks in the past five years .
" it is an ongoing task .
and these investigations into police corruption are only possible because there are people brave enough to denounce them , " piotti said , promising a major overhaul of the provincial police next month .

" there are people who are taking advantage of the news to put pressure on rates , however , there are enough players who will buy and that will keep rates from rising too much , " said one dealer .

tension builds in mexican state ahead of elections .
[ corrected 05:53 gmt ]
chilpancingo , mexico 1996-08-28
pre-electoral bickering flared on wednesday in the troubled western mexican state of guerrero as some opposition politicians demanded the army pull out of the area ahead of an upcoming state poll .
the mayor of acatepec , a small town some 310 miles ( 500 km ) south of mexico city , sent a letter to mexico 's national human rights commission complaining the army 's heavy presence in the town would interfere with the oct. 6 election .
mayor antonio gonzalez garcia , of the opposition revolutionary workers ' party , said in wednesday 's letter that army troops recently raided several local farms , stole cattle and raped women .
the letter was signed by some 200 area residents and indigenous leaders .
some electoral watchdog groups also said the presence of the army , which has fanned out across the state in the past month in search of a new guerrilla group , was likely to intimidate voters and had stirred up tension in the state .
a french group of electoral observers , agir ensemble pour les droits de l'homme , concluded the army presence exerted a heavy psychological pressure on local farmers and would prevent a fair vote .
up for grabs in the election are the state legislature and 75 town halls .
( corrects to show elections are not for governor ) .
despite the criticism , acting state gov .
angel aguirre pledged the elections will be free and fair and said he did not expect any trouble from the elusive new guerrilla group , the popular revolutionary army .
" the electoral process has been proceeding in accordance with the new state electoral law , " aguirre said , adding that the poll would be " an exercise in true democracy . "

a thai consular official has fled hong kong after being questioned by anti-corruption police in connection with soliciting bribes to issue a passport , hong kong government radio said on thursday .
the unnamed suspect left the british colony after being detained and then freed by the independent commission against corruption ( icac ) , the radio said .
the man was released after his arrest on tuesday , pending further inquiries , the icac said in a statement .
the anti-graft body was discussing the case with the thai government , especially the suspect 's status , it said .
it is not clear if the fugitive had diplomatic status in hong kong , and officials from the thai consulate were not available for comment .
the arrest came after the icac received a complaint that the man had demanded a bribe of hk$ 100,000 ( us$ 12,940 ) to issue a thai passport , the icac said .

thai poll shows military wants pm banharn out .
bangkok 1996-08-29
thailand 's powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and prime minister banharn silpa-archa 's resignation might solve the nation 's political and economic woes , an opinion poll showed on thursday .
nearly half the 1,617 military personnel surveyed in the rajapat institute poll suggested that banharn resign , while about 28 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 24 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government 's problems .
banharn , who leads a six-party , 13-month-old coalition government , faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month .
the prime minister , who has already lost one coalition partner this month , is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners .
the poll , conducted earlier this month after banharn 's coalition completed one year in office , showed the military would prefer general chatichai choonhavan -- a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in february 1991 -- as prime minister .
defence minister chavalit yongchaiyudh , head of coalition member the new aspiration party , was the second choice for prime minister , the poll showed .
banharn came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes .
nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere , and 65 percent blamed the government 's poor performance for the country 's economic slowdown .
the opinion of the military in thailand , which has seen 17 coups or attempted coups since the country switched to parliamentary democracy from absolute monarchy in 1932 , always carries weight in the political scene , despite officials ' vows to distance the military from politics .

israeli prison officials took jailed islamic militant hamas founder sheikh ahmed yassin to hospital briefly on thursday for medical tests , officials said .
" this evening sheikh yassin completed medical checks and returned to ramle prisons authority medical centre , " said a spokesman for israel 's internal security ministry .
a prison official said yassin had a mild case of pneumonia .
the 60-year-old moslem cleric , jailed by israel since 1989 , is serving a life sentence for ordering attacks by hamas guerrillas against israeli targets .
the ailing yassin is the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist hamas group which has killed scores of israelis in suicide attacks aimed at wrecking israel-plo peace deals .
palestinian president yasser arafat has demanded that israel release yassin -- who is confined to a wheelchair -- on humanitarian grounds .
israel said last month after it recovered the body of a soldier abducted by hamas seven years ago that it would consider freeing yassin .

scandal hits clinton campaign at vital moment .
michael conlon
chicago 1996-08-29
president bill clinton 's triumphal appearance at the democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal .
clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist dick morris abruptly announced his resignation on thursday .
the tabloid star magazine reported the married morris had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with clinton , and with whom he shared white house speeches before they were made .
" dick morris is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , " clinton said in a written statement . "
i am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . "
morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue .
the surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of clinton 's lead over dole in the opinion polls .
senator dianne feinstein , a california democrat , called it a " big bump " in the way of the clinton campaign .
" it comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , " feinstein said .
clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the democratic convention opening at 8 p.m. edt ( midnight gmt ) .
the 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers .
republicans hope to seize on the " character " issue to bolster clinton 's challenger bob dole in the final weeks of the campaign .
speaking in santa barbara , california , dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of morris , who had advised clinton to chart a more centrist political course , would make clinton drift back to the left .
" morris has been trying to make president clinton a republican , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal democrat that he really is , " dole told reporters .
clinton will hit the road on friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of franklin d. roosevelt .
aides said clinton planned to spend most of thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech .
it was apparently neglected on his long " whistle-stop " train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland .
he was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest .
but first lady hillary rodham clinton told abc television , " he 's really fired up . "
" he wants to outline to the american people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , " she said .
" he 's very excited about this convention ...
he 's excited about the campaign .
but more than that , he 's very resolute about what he wants to do . "
" i do n't take anything for granted .
i always expect elections to get close .
i expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , " she said of the november 5 election date .
clinton is leading dole by as much as 15 points according to some polls .
the campaign pits dole , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident clinton , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience .

researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy .
philadelphia 1996-08-29
university of pennsylvania researchers on thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals .
word of the findings , to be published in the oct. 1 issue of the journal " human gene therapy , " came in advance of the annual jerry lewis labour day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research .
several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials .
nevertheless , " a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , " the university of pennsylvania medical centre said in a release .
muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .
death strikes in early adulthood .
individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .
in the study at the university 's institute for human gene therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene .
the virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .
in the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .
similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .
the university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .

help-wanted ad index fell in july .
new york 1996-08-29
the help-wanted advertising index fell in july , the conference board said thursday , reflecting the uneven nature of the nation 's labour markets .
the monthly index fell to 83.0 in july against a reading of 85.0 in june , the private business research group said .
in july , the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine u.s. regions .
" the labour market has been expanding throughout 1996 , but in a very uneven pattern , " conference board economist ken goldstein said . "
recent want-ad figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity . "
with 2.5 percent gross domestic product growth expected for 1996 , new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year .
" with the unemployment rate staying close to about 5.5 percent over the last two years , there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 5.0 percent by the end of the year , " goldstein said .
the july index matched the reading for july , 1995 .
the greatest declines in the volume of help-wanted advertising were in the new england , mountain and west south central regions .
the greatest increase was in the east north central region .
police seek suspects in atlantic city jewel heist .
atlantic city , n.j. 1996-08-29
atlantic city police said thursday they were seeking two men and two women in connection with a $ 690,000 theft of jewelry and cash from a guest of the showboat hotel and casino .
capt .
richard andrews said police were seeking a man shown on a hotel videotape carrying a suitcase resembling the victim 's . "
we want to talk to him , " andrews said of the man .
a second man and two women also were being sought .
the thefts occurred sunday when the victim , new york jewelry wholesaler jerry schein , left three suitcases in a closet at somerset jewellers in the hotel while he checked out .
while he was gone , two women in their mid-twenties and an older man entered the jewelry store and tried to distract store owner charles mcgilley .
when schein returned two of the suitcases were missing .
they contained $ 650,000 in jewelry and $ 40,000 in cash , andrews said .
he said the man on the videotape did not match the description given by the jewelry store owner .
o.j. simpson hints at more supporting evidence .
jackie frank
washington 1996-08-29
o.j. simpson said on thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month .
the former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last october of the murders of his former wife , nicole brown simpson , and her friend , ronald goldman , in june 1994 .
he now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths .
he told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers .
but he added without elaborating , " hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . "
the judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public .
" i would love to speak about everything , " said simpson , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward .
his lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts sept .
17 will be that he did not kill the victims .
simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book .
he added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home .
" i 'm broke .
i am not crying the blues .
i can get along just fine , " he said . "
whatever you want to send me , i need . "
he again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on wednesday in an address at a jam-packed washington church .
contrary to news reports , simpson said , he has received support from both blacks and whites .
he again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges .
a crowd of 2,000 paid $ 10 a head to hear the former star running back for the buffalo bills professional football club and a football hall of fame member on wednesday night .
the crowd in the church was wildly supportive , showering simpson with gifts and praise .
but outside , dozens of protesters from the d.c. coalition against domestic violence called for the church to support victims of violence instead .
clinton adviser morris announces resignation .
chicago 1996-08-29
president bill clinton 's top political strategist dick morris resigned on thursday , saying he did not want to become an issue in clinton 's re-election campaign .
in a written statement , distributed by the clinton campaign , morris avoided comment on published allegations that he had engaged in a year-long affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute .
the statement from morris said that he had submitted his resignation on wednesday night . "
while i served i sought to avoid the limelight because i did not want to become the message .
now , i resign so i will not become the issue , " he said .
the announcement followed a report in the weekly supermarket tabloid star magazine , reprinted in thursday 's editions of the new york post , that the married adviser had hired a 37-year-old prostitute on a weekly basis while visiting washington to advise clinton on his re-election campaign .
" i will not subject my wife , family or friends to the sadistic , vitriol of yellow journalism .
i will not dignify such journalism with a reply or an answer .
i never will , " his statement said .
it was distributed to reporters at the press centre of clinton 's democratic convention headquarters just hours before the president was to address the delegates accepting the party 's nomination for a second four-year term in the white house .
u.s. surgeon investigated for discarding foot .
charleston , s.c. 1996-08-29
health officials said on thursday they were investigating the discovery of an amputated foot on a beach near charleston to determine whether a local surgeon had improperly disposed of infectious waste .
the foot , which washed up on sullivan 's island beach this month , was amputated three years ago from a child whose legs were deformed .
the foot had to be removed so the infant could be fitted with a prosthesis .
an orthopedic surgeon was given permission by the child 's parents and the hospital to keep the foot for research and educational purposes .
health officials said the surgeon told authorities he stored the foot in his freezer at home , but the freezer recently broke down and the contents spoiled .
the surgeon , who apologised for the incident , said he decided to put the foot in a crab trap to remove the flesh .
the foot later washed up on the beach .
florida cop disguised as shrub nabs bad guys .
miami 1996-08-29
it was a bush that bagged the bad guys .
when four would-be robbers , armed and masked , showed up to rob a checker 's restaurant in the fort lauderdale suburb of pembroke pines on tuesday , they had no idea the shrub near the drive-through window was toting a shotgun .
detective earl feugill , camouflaged as a shaggy green bush , ordered them to freeze . "
they were quite surprised , " he told the miami herald .
feugill said he made the hot , heavy suit , which he first used in the marines , by attaching strips of burlap to a camouflage outfit .
green and black face paint completed his disguise .
he was staking out the restaurant after a series of robberies at local fast-food places .
pembroke pines police said five people were arrested as a result of the 90-minute stakeout , including the four robbers and a restaurant employee who was allegedly prepared to let them in a back door .

eu barley sale worth $ 145 / t , for saudi - sources .
paris 1996-08-29
a european union sale of 234,324 tonnes of german intervention barley is worth some $ 145 per tonne fob germany and is mostly destined for saudi arabia , european grain sources said on thursday .
the eu 's cereals management committee sold 234,324 tonnes of german intervention barley at a minimum price of 105.07 ecus per tonne .
saudi arabia provisionally bought 800,000 tonnes of optional-origin barley at an august 21 tender at prices between $ 160 and $ 162 including cost , insurance and freight , traders said last week .
but european grain traders and officials said the saudis might reduce the purchase to 600,000 tonnes .
traders have said a substantial part of the deal was likely to come from the european union , which enjoys a supply and freight advantage over other producers .
but subtracting freight costs , the equivalent fob price of the deal is around $ 142 , well below the $ 149 per tonne floor price which the eu put on its barley as news of the deal emerged last week .
last thursday the eu sold 34,277 tonnes of german intervention barley at a minimum price of 109.36 ecus per tonne , which was seen as worth $ 149 per tonne fob .

salang tunnel reopened linking kabul with north .

the salang tunnel linking kabul with northern afghanistan was formally reopened to traffic on thursday under an agreement between the government and an opposition militia , witnesses said .
they said dozens of trucks began moving through the tunnel from both directions after the road reopened .
the salang tunnel , the main supply route for soviet troops when they were occupying afghanistan in the 1980s , had been closed since 1994 when northern militia leader general abdul rashid dostum rebelled against the kabul government .
witnesses said wrecked tanks and vehicles littered both sides of the heavily-mined road .
mines had been removed from the road itself , but experts of the halo trust mine clearance agency said it would take a week to clear the roadsides .

socal edison sees 2 power lines back today .

southern california edison co said it expected two 220 kilovolt ( kv ) power lines in southern california to resume service later today after being shut late wednesday because of a wildfire raging north of los angeles .
" they are expected to be placed in service later today , " said company spokesman steve conroy , adding repair crews have been removing smoke and other fire-related residues , which had settled on the two lines .
the shutdown of the 220 kv lines reduced by 500 megawatts ( mw ) the amount of power which the area received from socal edison 's 1,200 mw sierra hydroelectric facility , he said .
conroy noted two 500 kv and another 220 kv line running from the sierra plant to los angeles remained in operation , and continued to carry some of the production from sierra to the region .
on monday , the two 500 kv transmission cables were taken out of service , also for cleaning , for about a day .
containment of the fire has been difficult because of the hot , arid , windy weather in the region , conroy said .
" the fires keep moving back because of the winds , " he said , forcing the utility to shut those transmission lines for a second time this week .
local authorities charged a teenager for starting the blaze .

sierra semiconductor jumps on exit plan .
martin wolk
seattle 1996-08-29
sierra semiconductor corp jumped 23 percent thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business .
the san jose , calif. , company was up 2-1/8 at 11-3/8 after its announcement wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment .
" certainly the company will be a much smaller company now , but it will be a more profitable business , " said analyst elias moosa of roberston stephens & co .
but analysts noted that sierra still has much painful work ahead of it , including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its workforce , which currently has 500 people , and building up the business of its pmc-sierra unit , which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks .
the company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 50 million to $ 80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments .
scott randall of soundview financial group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business .
" once you announce your intention to exit a business , it becomes a complete buyer 's market , " he said .
and he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business , the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as international business machines corp .
" as the market develops the question is , are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? "
randall said .
other analysts were more bullish , even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales .
" it 's a positive strategic move , " said miles kan of hambrecht & quist .
" the modem business is a low-margin , commodity business , " he said .
the company 's pmc-sierra unit generated $ 33 million of the company 's $ 117 million in sales in the first half of the year , compared with $ 45 million in sales of modem chips , kan said .
but the pmc unit is far more profitable , he said .
sierra 's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand .

oasis singer heads for u.s. after illness .
london 1996-08-29
liam gallagher , singer of britain 's top rock group oasis , flew out on thursday to join the band three days after the start of its u.s. tour .
gallagher made his usual obscene gestures and swore at journalists as he prepared to fly from london 's heathrow airport to chicago .
" i hate you f... ing lot , yet you 're always asking me too many things .
i 'm not a supermodel you know , " he said .
on monday , just 15 minutes before his flight was due to depart , liam decided not to travel with the rest of the group , which includes his brother noel .
liam caught a taxi back to london saying he had " problems at home " .
he was believed to be suffering from laryngitis and said he had to go house-hunting with actress girlfriend patsy kensit .
when they first heard that liam had not flown out with the band at the start of the tour , many u.s. fans asked for refunds on their concert tickets .
the group began the u.s. tour , which is scheduled to last until september 18 , with a concert in chicago on tuesday at which noel gallagher filled in for his brother as lead singer .
slough estates helps lift property sector .
london 1996-08-29
a strong set of interim results and an upbeat outlook from slough estates plc helped to boost the property sector on thursday .
shares in slough , which earlier announced a 14 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 37.4 million stg , climbed nearly six percent , or 14p to 250 pence at 1009 gmt , while british land added 12-1 / 2p to 468p , land securities rose 5-1 / 2p to 691p and hammerson was 8p higher at 390 .
traders said positive comment from investment banks merrill lynch and sbc warburg also fueled the gains .
one dealer said positive stances from merrill lynch and sbc warburg were the key factors behind the gains .
a spokesman for merrill lynch said the bank was preparing to issue a note on the sector . "
we have been very positive ( on property ) , " he said , adding : " on a technical basis it is our most favoured sector . "
sbc warburg issued an update on the property sector on thursday , saying that most of the predictions it made at the start of the year were being realised .
" in the property market it is a case of so far , so good , " a member of sbc warburg 's property team said .
sbc warburg said it is maintaining its forecast for five percent growth in rental incomes during 1996 , but it has shaved its forecast for capital growth to five percent from six .
the spokesman said sbc warburg has also put an " add " recommendation on slough estates ' shares , but added that this " is a general move , not because of the results . "
slough 's chairman sir nigel mobbs added to the bullish mood in the sector , saying in a statement that " with the prospect of a period of steady economic growth and low inflation ahead , there is good reason to believe that the property sector should continue its improvement . "

jordanian pm kabariti meets arafat in west bank .
ramallah , west bank 1996-08-29
jordanian prime minister abdul-karim al-kabariti began talks with palestinian president yasser arafat in the west bank on thursday on the stalled middle east peace process , officials said .
kabariti flew by helicopter to palestinian-ruled ramallah and after a brief arrival ceremony went into talks with arafat .
the prime minister 's visit , his first trip outside the country since jordan was shaken by food riots earlier this month , came against the backdrop of a palestinian general strike in the west bank and gaza .
arafat called the four-hour strike , which ended at noon ( 0900 gmt ) to protest against israeli policy on settlements and jerusalem .
jordan 's official state news agency petra said kabariti would hold discussions " on the latest developments in the peace process and bilateral cooperation " .
iran says five spy networks destroyed , 41 held .
tehran 1996-08-29
iranian security forces have broken up five espionage rings in northwestern iran and arrested 41 people on charges of spying for unnamed countries , a daily newspaper said on thursday .
jomhuri eslami quoted the west azerbaijan province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information , photographing strategic sites , doing propaganda against state officials and " spreading pan-turkism " .
it was not clear if they were the same five spy rings , allegedly led by turkish diplomats , that iran said in april it had broken up in the same area , which borders turkey .
the april arrests were announced shortly after a row in which tehran asked ankara to withdraw four turkish diplomats accused of spying , and turkey expelled four iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of iranian exiles .
ties between the two neighbours , strained also over a military accord between turkey and israel which drew strong iranian objections , have improved since islamist necmettin erbakan took over as turkish prime minister in june .
the daily iran on thursday quoted intelligence minister ali fallahiyan as saying agents arrested 137 people for allegedly spying for iraq , the united states and other unnamed countries in the iranian year which ended on march 19 .
mideast gulf oil outlook - india holds the key .
dubai 1996-08-29
india will continue to hold the key to the middle distillates product market in the middle east gulf in the short term , traders in the region said on thursday .
they said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 1 , and are likely to remain strong in the near term .
" on the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality .
some are commanding a very good premium of 95 cents to one dollar .
it 's been 99 cents to korea .
this will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , " one said .
" but for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 45-50 cents .
the differential is not normally as wide as this , " he added .
another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 65 and 75 cents .
one trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at dubai ports , demand looked to exceed supply in the near term .
jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 - $ 27.70 a barrel fob gulf on thursday , up from $ 27.22 last week .
dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks , before they get a boost in the second half of september from demand for october cargoes .
gas oil , assessed at $ 24.00 - $ 24.20 a barrel fob gulf , was little changed on thursday from last week 's $ 24.10 - $ 24.24 .
" on gas oil , in the near term demand and supply are balanced to a bit short , there are some enquiries into east africa and short covering in india , " said one trader .
" the indians have awarded three cargoes , but the question is whether they will come out for more , " he added .
india has acquired 120,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes , bound for the west coast , in its october tender .
traders said the award could be india 's lowest in recent years .
" after ioc 's very small purchase of 120,000 tonnes , i 'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of october , " another said .
but traders see the market remaining tight in the short-term , with some surplus arising closer to october .
" i see an overhang of gas oil further out , " one said .
" gas oil will remain tight in the short term up to mid-september with the premium of around $ 1 for 0.5 percent ( sulphur material ) .
in the second half of september and october we see the premium coming off to 70-75 cents . "
traders said there was not much demand for one percent sulphur material gas oil , with the premium at 40 to 45 cents .

dubai 1996-08-29
washington 's new ambassador to saudi arabia , wyche fowler , arrived in the kingdom to take up his post , the u.s. embassy in riyadh said on thursday .
fowler , a lawyer and former senator , arrived late on wednesday , the embassy said in a statement .

jerusalem 1996-08-29
palestinians reopened their shops on thursday at the end of a four-hour strike called by president yasser arafat to protest against israel 's policy on jewish settlements and jerusalem , witnesses said .
shopkeepers in arab east jerusalem rolled up their shutters some 10 minutes before the scheduled noon ( 0900 gmt ) end of the stoppage .
palestinian leaders called the strike , the first in the west bank and gaza since 1994 , a warning signal that the peace process with israel was in danger .
witnesses said most shops were closed in towns and villages in the areas , with the exception of hebron , a west bank city still under israeli occupation .

washington 1996-08-29
former secretary of state james baker made a secret trip to syria in march 1995 in an unsuccessful bid to break an impasse in negotiations between syria and israel , the washington post reported on thursday .
the paper said baker declined to discuss the trip , but authorised an associate to confirm it took place and give an account of it .
news of the secret trip came after baker trashed the clinton administration at the republican national convention two weeks ago for its efforts to nudge syria into peace with israel .
baker made the march 1995 trip on the explicit understanding that it remain a secret , but after his speech at the gop convention , israel 's outgoing ambassador itamar rabinovich told a reporter about it , the post said .
baker was secretary of state in the republican administration of president george bush .

a freed black man writes to his still-enslaved wife , a mother pleads with abraham lincoln on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the u.s. civil war back to life .
working in the basement of the national archives , members of the civil war conservation corps are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the north so that they can be preserved on microfilm .
the faded documents have been stowed away in the archives since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day .
each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs .
since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on african american troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war .
more than 185,000 black soldiers fought and 37,000 died .
in one letter , a black soldier heading south wrote his wife , " though great is the present national difficulties yet i look forward to a brighter day when i shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom .
" i would like to no ( sic ) if you are still in slavery if you are , it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty .
great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me . "
in another letter dated january 1865 , a well-to-do washington matron wrote to lincoln to plead for her son , who faced a dishonourable discharge from the army . "
james is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly , while those who have done nothing for the cause are free , " she wrote .
lincoln 's notation on the letter read : " if his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , i will pardon and send him . "
the soldier was subsequently pardoned .
while the letters speak to the anguish of separation , a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war .
in a picture required for his military discharge , pvt .
lewis martin , with haunted eyes , posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg , blown off during a battle at petersburg , virginia , in july 1864 .
the work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture , said john simon , professor of history at southern illinois university at carbondale and editor of gen .
ulysses grant 's papers .
" these ( writings ) are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove .
this is the first generation of african americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment , " simon said .
" i think there 's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war , " said edward smith , director of american studies at american university in washington .
the war between the north and south raged for nearly four years , claimed the lives of half a million americans and forever seared the nation 's consciousness .
southern records have already been preserved .
they were put on microfilm about 30 years ago through a grant from the united daughters of the confederacy .
the civil war conservation corps is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year .
director budge weidman , who has shepherded the project from the beginning , predicts it will take up to a decade to complete .
the work was inspired by a national park service plan to put computer databases at civil war battlefields across the country so that americans might research their ancestors .
the records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day .
one soldier was discharged because of " mental incapacity and inebetude ( sic ) of the brain , alleged by the patient to be connected with a fall on the head but believed to arise from long continued and excessive masturbation . "

new bomb attacks on corsica despite crackdown vow .
sylvie florence
ajaccio , corsica 1996-08-29
separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the french mediterranean island of corsica despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by paris , police said on thursday .
in the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of agriculture ministry offices located just 50 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital ajaccio .
no one was hurt .
a second device , packed with five kg ( 10 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said .
the new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new " get-tough " policy by paris toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy .
interior minister jean-louis debre , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily la corse in a statement he had given " firm orders " to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice .
judges on the island had accused paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed .
the latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless .
" no searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , " the daily france-soir lamented .
" on the island , as at the place beauvau ( the interior ministry 's paris address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what .
it is time to end this nightly farce , " said the pro-government daily le figaro in an editorial .
no one immediately claimed responsibility for thursday 's incidents , which brought to 23 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-august , when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce .
corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades .
the daily le monde reported on wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the french mainland on the principle that " 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in corsica " .
the newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government .
sweden 's om to open london forest products bourse .
stockholm 1996-08-29
swedish options and derivatives exchange om gruppen ab said on thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in london in the first half of 1997 .
" together with subsidiaries omlx , the london securities & derivatives exchange and om stockholm , om gruppen will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 1997 , " om gruppen said in a statement .
the first commodity to be traded on the pulpex bourse will be pulp , but om said trade would be extended to include products such as timber , recycled paper and other paper qualities .
" through the establishment of pulpex , london will have a commodities bourse for forest products which complements existing bourses for oil , metals and ' softs ' ( coffee , sugar and cocoa ) , " om said .
pulpex was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between om and representatives of the forest industry , the company said .
huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers ' profitability unpredictable , and made investing in new production capacity a risky business .
" without the ability to hedge prices , changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players ' profitability , " om said .
it said global production of pulp amounted to around 200 million tonnes per year , of which around 20 percent or 40 million tonnes was sold on the spot market .
at current prices , the value of this production was around $ 25 billion .
pulpex will be both a marketplace and a clearing house , om said , adding that the british securities and investments board had been informed of om 's plans .
pulpex 's clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by om gruppen to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations .

galeforce winds and heavy rains batter belgium .
brussels 1996-08-29
torrential rains and galeforce winds battered belgium on thursday causing widespread damage as some areas had more rainfall in 24 hours than they normally get in a month , the meteorological office said .
cellars were flooded , trees uprooted and roofs damaged , but there were no reports of any injuries , an interior affairs ministry spokesman said .
some trains were delayed as fallen trees blocked lines .
brussels received 5.6 cm ( 2.24 inches ) of water in the past 24 hours -- compared to an average 7.4 cm ( 2.96 inches ) per month -- but in several communes in the south of the country up to 8 cm ( 3.2 inches ) fell , the royal meteorological institute ( rmt ) said .
the rmt spokesman said that near the eastern city of turnhout , a group of boy scouts camping in a low-lying meadow had to be evacuated as water flooded their tents .
the rain also severely hindered belgian investigators ' excavations in the southern village of jumet , where they are looking for bodies in one of the houses of the main character in a paedophile sex-and-murder scandal .
but the coastal towns got off lightly as the flooding that had been expected due to a combination of spring tides and high winds failed to materialise .

paris 1996-08-29
algerian security forces killed four moslem guerrillas on tuesday in a village south of the capital algiers , an algerian newspaper said on thursday .
the armed militants were shot dead in nahar village 90 km ( 56 miles ) south of algiers , liberte newspaper said .
security forces also killed an unspecified number of members of a rebel gang on wednesday in the leveilly suburb of algiers , le matin newspaper reported .
an estimated 50,000 people , mostly moslem militants and security forces members , have been killed in violence pitting moslem guerrillas against government forces since early 1992 , when authorities cancelled a general election in which islamists had taken a commanding lead .
finns hold two men on child sex-abuse charges .
helsinki 1996-08-29
finnish police said on thursday they had arrested two men suspected of sexually abusing a captive 13-year-old girl , but did not believe the case was linked to others in europe .
the men , both finns aged about 40 , were arrested last saturday in the western town of tampere in a raid on a luxury boat owned by one of them .
the girl was being held on the boat and had sought help from a passer-by , police chief inspector ilkka laasonen said .
" this is an individual case and i do n't have any evidence linking the suspects to any other cases , " laasonen said .
the girl was taken to hospital .
the men could face charges carrying up to six to 10 years in prison , he said .
witnesses had reported seeing many young women and some girls who looked clearly underage at parties around the boat in recent weeks , the daily newspaper iltalehti said .
audi ceo says expects no 96 currency impact .
ingolstadt 1996-08-29
audi ag management board chairman herbert demel said on thursday that the german luxury carmaker , a unit of volkswagen ag , did not expect any burden on its 1996 results from currency market volatility .
" we do not expect any burden on our 1996 results from currency markets , " demel told reuters in an interview .
audi would have been able to report a profit 300 million marks higher in 1995 if exchange rates had stayed the same as in 1994 , demel had told a shareholder meeting last april .
demel said the carmaker had hedged about half of its currency risk for 1996 .

helsinki 1996-08-29
fertilisers and saplings maker kekkila oy said on thursday in a statement it expected a falling result trend in the latter half of the year , but a full-year profit was nevertheless likely .
" due to natural seasonal fluctuations in operations , the end-year result trend will be falling , but based on the early year result trend a profitable result is likely to be achieved , " kekkila said in its january-june interim report .

in the first half , kekkila posted a 6.1 million markka profit , up from 0.7 million .

interview-t&n untroubled by margin pressure .
london 1996-08-29
the chairman of british-based components and engineering group t&n plc said on thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets .
in an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , sir colin hope said t&n had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets .
looking at market prospects , he said : " i think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half . "
" it 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year .
it could be better , or it could be worse , " hope added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries .
" you can see anxieties in germany and france , in particular , beginning to grow and develop .
america , however , is looking a little better , " he said .
compared with the end of last year , when t&n predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , hope said : " i think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half . "
against this background , hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago .
" i think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern african ) mines actually is not bad .
" it does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , " he added , saying : " we continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle . "
" we 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it .
and we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things , " hope said .
" when the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , " he added .
commenting on the continued struggle to get control of german piston maker kolbenschmidt , which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles , hope said t&n 's confidence " continues to improve " that it may eventually be able to proceed .

earthquake jolts new zealands south island .
wellington 1996-08-29
an earthquake measuring 5.5 on the richter scale shook new zealands upper south island on thursday but there were no reports of injuries , television new zealand said .
it said the quake , centred near the small town of waiau , was strongly felt in the cities of nelson and christchurch .
some minor damage had been reported in the spa town of hanmer .
new zealand is prone to frequent earthquakes but they rarely cause major damage .
the country has only 3.5 million people in an area about the size of britain or japan .
hong kong 's tsang sees growth , smooth transition .
mark trevelyan
wellington 1996-08-29
hong kong financial secretary donald tsang said on thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year .
tsang , who made the remarks during a visit to new zealand , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the hong kong dollar pegged to its u.s. counterpart , and said negotiations with china on next year 's budget were going smoothly .
hong kong 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year .
second quarter growth estimates will be released when the hong kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on friday .
" our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , " tsang told a news conference after meeting new zealand finance minister bill birch .
" there will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , " he said .
he said inflation was under control and the hong kong dollar was " rock solid " .
its link to the u.s. dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years .
" there 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change .
a lot of investment in hong kong , some of which ( is ) by china , is predicated on the link continuing . "
britain will hand over hong kong to chinese sovereignty at midnight on june 30 , 1997 .
tsang said three sets of meetings with chinese authorities on hong kong 's 1997-98 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . "
none of our basic precepts have been challenged . "
hong kong will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves .
it will have no duty to contribute any taxes to beijing , tsang said .
he described the condition of the property market as " very good indeed " .
" you know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years .
because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . "
tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce .
the government would put land on the market to stop rentals " going through the roof " , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems .
" there will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , " he said in reference to the property market .
tsang , the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary , said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under british rule and three years under china .
taiwan dollar ends higher , narrow trade seen .
taipei 1996-08-29
the taiwan dollar closed slightly firmer on thursday amid tight taiwan dollar liquidity in the banking system , and dealers said the rate was likely to move narrowly in the near term .
the taiwan dollar fell in early trade on month-end u.s. dollar demand , but the downtrend was later reversed as taiwan dollar liquidity tightened . "
banks do not want to hold big u.s. dollar positions at this moment , " said one dealer , adding that the rate was likely to hover around current levels .
the rate closed at t$ 27.482 against wednesday 's t$ 27.495 .

indonesia sought on thursday to play down a fire bomb attack on a u.s. consulate earlier this week , saying it was being treated as a criminal rather than a political act , the official antara news agency said .
the police are still investigating the incident .
it is evident the happening is not politically motivated but just an ordinary criminal act , the news agency quoted east java military commander major-general utomo as saying .
the tuesday morning attack on the consulate in indonesias second largest city of surabaya , caused slight damage to a guard house before being quickly extinguished , a spokesman at the u.s. embassy in jakarta , 700 km ( 430 miles ) west of surabaya , said on wednesday .
no one was injures , he said .
nobody should try and exaggerate it by calling it a bomb because it was just a molotov cocktail , utomo said .
he said police were investigating the incident and patrols around diplomatic offices in surabaya would be stepped up .

hk civil servants contest ban on china panel .
hong kong 1996-08-29
senior hong kong civil servants were given the go-ahead on thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the beijing-backed panel to choose the territory 's first post-handover leader and lawmakers .
the supreme court ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on september 11 , three days before the nomination period for the selection committee closes .
the government maintains the ban , announced earlier this month , is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy .
civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights .
the 400-strong selection committee will select hong kong 's future chief executive to replace the british governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which beijing plans to dissolve .
hong kong , a british colony for more than 150 years , will be handed back to china at midnight on june 30 next year .
china intends to dismantle the territory 's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes britain 's recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber , a decision that has generated considerable controversy .
the judicial review sought by directorate-grade bureaucrats will apply to only about 1,000 of the approximately 33,000 civil servants affected .
police unions are not contesting the ban , which affects all 27,000 officers , and nor are the very top tier of hong kong 's mandarin class , the policy secretaries .
more than 16,000 application forms for places on the selection committee have been handed out since the nomination period opened .
it closes on september 14 .

singapore refining company ( src ) is expected to shutdown its 60,000 barrel-per-day ( bpd ) crude distillation unit ( cdu ) in september , an industry source said on thursday .
" they think something is stuck , " the source said . "
but nothing has been decided as they are still waiting for an x-ray machine to determine the problem . "
the source said the problem was discovered during the past month during which time cdu no.3 's production has varied from maximum capacity of 60,000 bpd to as low as 40,000 bpd , depending on the crude being run .
" we are having a lot of problems , " said a source .
an earlier problem with cdu no .
3 arose on july 24 when an industry source said the cdu would be closed down briefly in august for repairs to a heat exchanger .
but by mid-august , a company spokesman said repairs had been carried out without any shutdown .
the 285,000 bpd src refinery is co-owned by the singapore petroleum company , british petrolem and caltex , the joint-venture of u.s. majors chevron corp and texaco inc .

lenzing expects negative results in h2 .
vienna 1996-08-29
austrian viscose fibre maker lenzing ag said on thursday it expected to post negative group results in the second half of the year after posting losses in the first six months .
" a preview of the second half of 1996 does not reveal any signs of a significant improvement in market conditions , " lenzing said in a statement released ahead of its earnings conference .
for the first six months of the year , lenzing said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period .
the group attributed the first-half losses to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres , as well as sluggish economies in the west .

algeria faults britain over islamists gathering .
paris 1996-08-28
algeria , fighting a vicious war against moslem fundamentalist guerrillas , attacked britain on wednesday for allowing islamist groups to meet in london .
the islamist gathering , due to be held in london on september 8 , has triggered concern and anger in several other arab countries like egypt which is also fighting armed moslem fundamentalists .
british jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said palestinian islamist hamas as well as the banned algerian islamic salvation front ( fis ) are among those radical islamists attending the conference .
a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on algerian television that algeria " has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the arab and islamic world . "
" algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism , " the spokesman said , adding the algerian government has asked the british embassy in algiers for clarifications .
the algerian ambassador in london has also asked for clarification from the foreign office over the meeting of islamist groups .
algeria said " they are clearly working to undermine the stability " of arab countries .
british foreign secretary malcolm rifkind said on tuesday from pakistan his government would only take action against the planned islamists gathering in london if british law was broken .
" people who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in britain , " he said .
an estimated 50,000 people , including more than 110 foreigners , have been killed in algeria 's violence pitting moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when authorities in algeria cancelled a general election in which fis had taken a commanding lead .

wall street ponders rubin 's role if clinton wins .
donna sells
new york
the outcome of the november elections emerged as a hot topic on wall street this week as financial pundits debated whether robert rubin might forgo a second term as treasury secretary if president clinton is re-elected .
concern centred on the currency markets since rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .
speculation that rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future cabinet post during television interviews at the democratic convention in chicago this week .
should rubin leave , wall street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him .
rubin 's predecessor at the treasury , lloyd bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with japan .
" obviously , under the clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said chris widness , an international economist at chase securities inc. " under rubin , the u.s. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . "
that strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-second world war lows of 1.3438 german marks on march 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 japanese yen on april 19 , 1995 .
currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .
rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on wall street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of goldman , sachs and co .
inc .
" rubin has done a fine job in that position , " said michael faust , a portfolio manager at bailard , biehl and kaiser , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds .
" anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . "
fear that a new treasury secretary might favour a return to bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets .
some overseas investors might shy away from buying u.s. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening .
as for u.s. treasury securities , widness explained that alan greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the federal reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether rubin continues at the treasury .
" although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the united states , " said widness , adding that could hurt u.s. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds .
still , markets may have little to fear from any rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results .
if that is true , then any new treasury chief would need to be as effective as rubin in convincing markets that the white house does indeed want a strong currency .
" if he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' what 's your view on the dollar ? '
" said michael perelstein , portfolio manager of mainstay international funds .
" and all i can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as rubin ) , if not stronger , " perelstein said . "
otherwise , you get selling out of tokyo and frankfurt again . "

french central defender antoine kombouare has completed a 300,000 pounds sterling ( $ 467,000 ) move to aberdeen from swiss club sion , the scottish premier division club said on friday .
kombouare has signed a two-year contract and will make his debut against morton in the scottish league cup on tuesday .
but he will be ineligible for the rest of aberdeen 's uefa cup campaign as he has already played for sion in this season 's cup winners ' cup .
aberdeen manager roy aitken said : " it 's unfortunate for us that antoine cannot play in europe but he will help us achieve things in domestic competition .
" i have been watching him for several weeks now and have no doubts he brings real quality to the side .
he has a great deal of experience and i 'm sure he will quickly establish himself in both the team and the affection of our fans . "
the 32-year-old defender played seven seasons with nantes and was with paris st germain for five seasons .
he said former psg team mate david ginola , who now plays for english premier league newcastle , was influential in his move to scotland .
" i 'm a very good friend of david and spoke to him recently about coming to aberdeen and he was very positive about it , " kombouare said .
" he said i would really enjoy life there and that i would settle in in terms of football as well .
that , and the fact he is only a few hours drive away , influenced my decision to come to aberdeen . "
